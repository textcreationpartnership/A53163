            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE have given to this Volume the Title of <hi>The Third Volume of Moral Eſſays,</hi> becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign we had of joyning to the fame Work, and under the ſame Title, the Treatiſes which had appeared under that of the <hi>Education of a Prince,</hi> and of Compoſing a ſecond Volume of ESSAYS, being Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this here, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:110487:3"/>that, would have been but the Second, is now the Third.</p>
            <p>'Tis in Conſideration of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing under this ſame Title all the Treatiſes which are of the ſame nature, that we have added to this a ſmall Writing of Plays, whereof we had a Right to Diſpoſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome perſons had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready inſerted it in other Works. And we have been by ſo much more inclinable thereunto, as theſe Works were leſs common.

<pb facs="tcp:110487:3"/>to add thereunto likewiſe ſomething.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110487:6"/>a Philoſopher who hath oppoſed it, and who hath pretended that man ought to avoid knowing himſelf. What if ſome one hath paſſed even to this exceſs? he cannot do it but by ſuppoſing that Man is ſo unfortunate, and that his Evils are ſo without remedy, that he could not but encreaſe his Miſery by knowing himſelf. And ſo one ſhould always know ones ſelf, even to conclude by this ſtrange way of Arguing, <hi>That it is good not to know ones ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But that which is very ſtrange is, that being ſo united to grant the Importance of this Duty— they are ſtill far from practicing it. For, not labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeriouſly to obtain this knowledge, they are hardly employed all their life, but with care how to ſhun it. Nothing is more odious to them than this light, which diſcovers them to their proper eyes, and which obliges them to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch as they are. Thus they do all things to hide it from themſelves, and they eſtabliſh their quiet in living ignorantly and in the forgetfulneſs of their State and Condition.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A great Wit of this Age hath ſhewn, in an excellent Diſcourſe, that this deſire to avoid the knowledge of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110487:7"/>ones ſelf is the Fountain of all the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous occupations of men, and above all, of that which they call <hi>Divertiſement;</hi> That they ſeek in that only to rob themſelves of themſelves; That it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth to render a man Miſerable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to conſider himſelf, and that there is no human Felicity in this World which is able to endure this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus Man without Grace is ſo great a puniſhment to himſelf, that he inclines continually to fly from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he looks upon himſelf in ſome ſort as his own great Enemy, and that he thinks his happineſs conſiſts in being forgetful of himſelf, and running head-long into this forgetfulneſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This Inclination is not only the effect of an evil Cuſtom, nor of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſorder amongſt ſome men; it's the general propenſity of our corrupt Nature. We are out of our ſelves from the very moment of our Birth, and the Soul, which in her infancy doth only buſy herſelf with outward things and the Pleaſures of the Body, doth hereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe Objects and Pleaſures ſo famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to her, and cleaves ſo ſtrongly to them, that ſhe cannot enter again into herſelf, but by great trouble and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110487:7"/>And as ſhe finds not there what ſhe deſires, ſhe freeth herſelf the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhe can, and Melancholy inclines her to return preſently to thoſe other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to which ſhe applies herſelf with ſo much more eagerneſs, by how much more they aſſiſt her to forget her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Miſeries, the ſight whereof ſhe cannot undergo. <hi>Projicit ſe foras miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliter ſcalpi avide Contactu ſenſibilium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. But not to urge any farther that this not knowing ones ſelf muſt not be countenanced, and the better to dive to the bottom thereof, there muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that this knowledge is joyn'd in man to an inclination which appears quite contrary, and which makes him to regard himſelf in every thing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the greateſt Pleaſure of a proud man is to contemplate the <hi>Idea</hi> which he makes of himſelf. This <hi>Idea</hi> is the <hi>Origin</hi> of all his vain ſatisfactions: He relates all to it, and nothing pleaſeth him but in proportion as it contributes to puff it up, to adorn it, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it more lively.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Theſe two inclinations, whereof the one makes us to fly, and the other to ſeek the knowledge of our ſelves, are alike natural to a man; ſo ſpring they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110487:8"/>from the ſame Fountain, tho' in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they are oppoſite.</p>
                  <p>Man, as being vain, will ſee himſelf. He avoids ſeeing himſelf, becauſe being vain he is not able to ſuffer the ſight of his Faults and Miſeries. To accord theſe two contrary deſires, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to a Subtility worthy his Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which gives him means to ſatisfy them both at the ſame time. This Craft or Subtility is to cover all his Faults, to blot them, in ſome ſort, out of the Image which he hath formed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and only to include therein the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which may raiſe him in his own thoughts. If he hath them not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, he hath them imaginarily, and if he find them not in his proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he endeavours to ſeek them in the opinion of men, or in outward things which he joyns to his <hi>Idea,</hi> as if they made ſome part thereof; by means of this deceit he is always abſent from himſelf, and preſent to himſelf: He looks upon himſelf continually, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſees himſelf truly, becauſe he ſees, inſtead of himſelf, only the vain Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes he hath formed thereof.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. So when a <hi>Caribian</hi> repreſents himſelf to himſelf, he only ſees a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110487:8"/>figure reſembling the image which he hath ſeen of himſelf in the water; and beholding it as exact in Shooting, as dexterous in Fiſhing, as Maſter of a certain Cabin, as having ſlain ſuch and ſuch of his Enemies, as Husband to ſuch a Woman, he applies himſelf abſolutely to theſe Objects and <hi>Ideas</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them, and thus he paſſeth his whole life without reflecting on that part of his being which thinks and reaſoneth, not dreaming what it is, from whence it came, what will become of it, what may cauſe its good or bad Fortune.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be imagined that the Pride of other men acts otherways then this of theſe miſerable people. They adorn only this Image, which is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their love a little more. A Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain looking on himſelf ſees a Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome on Horſe back, who commands ſome Soldiers. A Prince ſees a man richly cloathed, who is looked on with reſpect, and who is obeyed every where. A Magiſtrate ſees a man dreſſed up with the Ornaments belonging to his Dignity, who is reſpected by others, becauſe he is in a condition to oblige or diſoblige them. A vain proud Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man looks on herſelf as an Idol, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110487:9"/>by her Beauty thoſe who behold her. An Uſurer ſees himſelf in the midſt of his Treaſures. An Ambitious man repreſents himſelf ſurrounded with people who humble themſelves at his Greatneſs. And ſo every one in all theſe actions have no other end, whereof ſelf-love is the Original, but to joyn always to the <hi>Idea</hi> that they have of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, new Ornaments and new Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. There is alſo a more ſpiritual <hi>Idea</hi> one hath of himſelf, which is, when not conceiving diſtinctly either good or bad qualities, one conceives only what is expreſſed by the word <hi>Me;</hi> and this word conceived in this manner doth likewiſe hide from us all our faults, and doth ſuffice to gain our love. The ſecret apprehenſion we have thereof creeps in every where; we relate all thereto; this is the principle of the moſt part of Pleaſures that we enjoy. And though we ſhould come to unfold or unravel what this <hi>Me</hi> comprehends, we ſhould find therein nothing lovely, and may be nothing which would not give horrour; nevertheleſs we love it under this ſo confuſed <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Me,</hi> and we ſhun in it the diſtinct and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110487:9"/>apprehenſion which makes us hate it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. From whence think you proceeds this trouble, which overwhelms thoſe who have been in great places when forced to live at quiet in their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? It is not only becauſe they ſee themſelves too clearly, and that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion they have of their Miſeries and Faults doth trouble them. Perchance that is one of the reaſons of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, but not the only one. It is alſo becauſe they do not ſee themſelves throughly, and that there are few things which renew the <hi>Idea</hi> of their <hi>Me.</hi> This <hi>Idea</hi> cauſeth their pleaſure during their fortune, and its loſs their diſpleaſure du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their diſgrace: we love not to employ our ſelves in ſolitude; the Images which we form there are infinitely more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure then thoſe aided by outward Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Men in great Employments are advertiſed by all thoſe who addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to them, that they are Powerful, that they are able to hurt or to aſſiſt. A thouſand things doth ſtir up lively the <hi>Idea</hi> of their <hi>Me,</hi> and ſets it before their eyes with ſome agreeable and pleaſing quality of <hi>Great, Powerful,</hi> and of <hi>Reſpect.</hi> Common Civility does the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110487:10"/>ſame thing in reſpect of thoſe who live in the world. For as it is Fill'd with Teſtimonials of Eſteem, with Reſpect, and with Applications, it gives occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of repreſenting themſelves to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as being loved and eſteemed, and by conſequence as being lovely and eſteemable. And by a contrary reaſon theſe deſerts and ſolitudes do vex and trouble vain and ambitious men, becauſe they do not ſpeak to them of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and becauſe they would have them ſpeak of nothing elſe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. There is a pleaſure in hearing Self-love ſpeak when it is not diſguiſed at all, and that it diſcovers lively, what pleaſeth it in difficult occupations, wherewith it chargeth men. There is ſcarcely, for example, any more laborious than thoſe who ſpeak in publick, as Traitors and Advocates: they are obliged to charge their memories with a thouſand unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing affairs, and apply themſelves to find out devices and expreſſions to fill up their diſcourſes, to drain the forces of their bodies, and their Spirits, upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which they ſhall be glad to forget, as ſoon as they ſhall be diſcharged of their Offices. Nevertheleſs, becauſe there are many things in their profeſſions, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110487:10"/>renews the <hi>Idea</hi> of themſelves; thoſe who exerciſe them with Honor, think themſelves the happieſt of men. Let us but hear what one of theſe antient Orators upon this ſubject ſaid, to judge of what the reſt maintain. <q>What is there more ſweet,<note place="margin">Quintil. dia. Orat.</note> ſaid he, to an honeſt man, born for honeſt pleaſures, than to ſee his Houſe always full of people, and to know that they render him theſe reſpects, not becauſe of his Riches, nor out of hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Heirs; nor becauſe of ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he enjoyes, but in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; that even thoſe to whom we give reſpect, in hopes to be their Heirs, thoſe who are the richeſt, and the moſt in credit do come to ſee him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though oftentimes he be young &amp; poor, to the end, that they may recommend to him their own, or their friends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns? Is there any thing in Riches, and Grandeur, which can give pleaſure equal to that which he feels; when he ſees perſons conſiderable for their age, and whoſe credit is ſpead through all the world, to confeſs in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Riches which they enjoy, that they have not the firſt and greateſt of all worldly advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110487:11"/>which is that which an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor profeſſeth? What I ſay of that throng of people, who preſent themſelves to accompany him, or who go before him? What ſhall I ſay of the ſplendor with which he appears in publick, of the reſpect given him in mens opinions; of the joy which he conceives, when being raiſed to ſpeak ſingly in the midſt of a throng of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who liſten to him attentively, he ſees the eyes of all the Auditors turn'd towards him: That the people crowd to hear him, and that he ſtamps in all their minds the ſame Impreſſions, which he deſires to make appear in himſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold what made this Roman under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gt the troubles and diſguſts of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. And if all thoſe who are in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dangerous and painful employments ſpeak as ſimply as he; they would tell us alſo, that all that pleaſed them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is reduced to this <hi>Idea</hi> of their <hi>Me</hi> honoured and reſpected by others.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. We ſee cleerly enough by theſe examples, in what faſhion Self-love makes uſe of outward objects, to ſatisfy theſe two inclinations natural to men of knowing, and not knowing himſelf, not ſuffering on the one part, that he ſee himſelf otherwiſe, than by a confuſed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110487:11"/>
                     <hi>Idea,</hi> which repreſents to him no one fault; and adding thereto on the other part, all that he can of exterior things, which give him means to fix there unto a phantaſtick Image of Greatneſs. But this nevertheleſs doth not ſuffice man to procure him the reſt; and the pleaſure which he ſeeks, nor to avoid the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe faults, whereof he hath ſo much horror. He hath need of quite other inventions to ſhun the ſight of himſelf. In vain would he publiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abroad, he would not fail to find himſelf there, and a thouſand things would be able to ſet his faults before his eyes. He would ſee the Images thereof in all the faults, and in all the miſeries of others, which he could not avoid ſeeing, and which oftentimes he looks on, even with pleaſure. So that he would not find his account better out of himſelf, than in himſelf. There is great likelyhood, that if the fear of ſeeing himſelf, had made him go out, the Image of himſelf, which ſhould have been repreſented to him by all theſe outward Objects would have made him to enter again how unwilling foe-he might have been.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. To comprehend better in what manner man may be forced to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110487:12"/>by objects, which are out of him, and what he doth to warrant himſelf from them it is neceſſary to conſider, that he does not look upon himſelf leſs according to a certain being which he hath in the imagination of others, than according to what he really is; and that he does not only draw his portraiture by what he himſelf knows of himſelf; but alſo by the ſight which he diſcovers in the minds of others. Becauſe we are all in reſpect of one another, as that man who ſerved as a model of the Practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners in the Academies of Painters. Each of thoſe, who environ us, do form to themſelves a portraiture of us, and the different ways wherewith our actions are obſerved do give leave to make them differently.</p>
                  <p>The great and the little, thoſe who have a good repute, and thoſe who have none; are hardly diſtinguiſhed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are more people who draw the Pictures of the one then of the others. How many draw the Portraiture of a Prince? All his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, all Forreign Countries are for him an Accademy of Painters, whereof he is the Model. Thoſe who are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote repreſent him by more groſs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110487:12"/>draughts. Thoſe who are nearer do draw his Picture more lively, and more reſembling. A mean man, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, who lives in his Family, is only Painted by the ſmall number of thoſe who know him, and the Portraitures which they make of him ſcarcely go out of the Limit of the Town.</p>
                  <p>But what is more conſiderable in this is, that men do not only draw the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures of others, but that they ſee alſo thoſe which are made of them, and if they would look on them indeed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be ſo capable to remedy their pride, nor more able to help to undeceive them then, even the ſight of theſe portraitures.</p>
                  <p>Let us chooſe the greateſt and moſt glorious man in the World, and allow him ſo great a Wit as to contemplate at once all this variety of Judgments which are made of him, and to enjoy fully the ſight of the thoughts and of the motions which he excites in others, there is no vanity can undergo this ſight. For a ſmall number of advantageous opinions he would ſee an infinite which would diſpleaſe him. He would ſee that the faults which he diſſembles, or which he doth not know, are in the eyes of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110487:13"/>moſt part of people; that they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves often about no other thing, and that men obſerve them only in this manner; he would ſee that the World is very little touched with all theſe fine qualities with which he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters himſelf that ſome ſee them not at all, others behold them with a cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, others only obſerve that in which they are defective, ſome hide and diſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure them, joyning thereunto ſome faults which they know in him, and that from all this he draws his own picture which is only proper to extinguiſh his Pride.</p>
                  <p>There needs only to learn to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves, that we open our eyes to all theſe ſeveral opinions men form of us, and Reaſon, if we deſire ſincerely to know them, will diſcover them. But becauſe vanity is an evil whereof we will not be cured, and that we place our happineſs not to be cured of it, we make uſe of an Invention, which how groſs ſoever it is doth nevertheleſs work its effect. It is, that although Reaſon in general be convinc'd that men form of us many Judgments not very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and that the Examples of thoſe we hear ever and anon made of others, and thoſe which we make of them our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110487:13"/>ſelves might inſtruct us, do neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in ſome ſort cauſe us not to ſee thoſe which are diſadvantagious to us, and to apply our ſelves cheiflly to thoſe which are advantageous to us. So in Baniſhing from our minds all theſe Objects which may be able to diſpleaſe us, in fixing our ſelves only to thoſe which are pleaſing to us, in deceiving our ſelves willingly, and in avoiding being deceived, our vanity remains half ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and procures this fond Pleaſure in which vain men place their falſe felicity.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. It is yet more eaſy that the great ones, and generally all thoſe whom it is our intent to pleaſe, do entertain themſelves in this Illuſion, becauſe inſtead of making for our ſelves only one Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of other men, we may in ſome ſort make two, the one interiour which is true, the other exteriour wherein we paint nothing but what we judge may pleaſe them; and great care is taken afterwards to ſet before their eyes only this falſe Picture, and to endeavour to make them take that for the true one. Without doubt they would eaſily hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves from being deceived therein, and might convince themſelves if they would, that there is nothing ſo
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110487:14"/>falſe and ſo vain as all theſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Eſteem and Aflection which men ſhew them. They know often what they think thimſelves of thoſe to whom they return the like, and they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to judge others more ſincere then themſelves. But they are eaſily held back in this point, and do not dive ſo deep into theſe things. They content themſelves therefore with this deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Surface, they leave there theſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour portraitures which they fear to diſcover, and they make a ſtop only at theſe flattering Pictures, which are made purpoſely to draw from them what we pretend thereby.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. We make uſe of the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to hinder that the faults and miſeries of others, and the Judgment which we ſee made of them, and which we our ſelves make of them, do not call us to our ſelves nor diſcover to us our own juglings. Wit aſſiſted by ſelf-love doth cut off all the reflections it can make, or applies it ſelf ſo little thereunto that they make ſcarcely any Impreſſion at all. We hear every hour people who deceive themſelves, ſpoken of with ſcorn. We ſee that they are the common objects of mens diſdain,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110487:14"/>becauſe there is nothing more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous then a man deceived, and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his own vanity. Nevertheleſs we do not think that we are thoſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and deceived men; let men ſay of us in our abſence what is faid of others before us, let us give therein as much Subject as they, and let there be no appearance that they have more reſpect for us then for all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>How frequent and how certain ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe objects may be, they have not more force to oblige the mind to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it ſelf, and there to ſee the ſame faults and the ſame miſeries then it ſees in others. Think we more on death for hearing or for ſeeing the death of thoſe with whom we have lived? We fly his Spectacle if we can; if we cannot fly it, yet we endeavour to fly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections it ought to produce. If we cannot ſtifle them abſolutely, we turn away from them with what expedition poſſible. What I have ſaid of Death may be ſaid of all the other Miſeries and of all Human Frailties, which may be able to repreſent ours to us. Theſe Images ſtrike us at every moment, but we endeavour as often to reſiſt, and not to be daunted. We deceive our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110487:15"/>ſelves if we can, and if we cannot do it abſolutely, at leaſt we ſtrive to turn our thoughts another way.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. What ſhould we ſay of a man who ſeeing his Picture every day in a Looking glaſs, and ſeeing it therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſhould not know it, and would never ſay <hi>Behold I am here?</hi> ſhould we not accuſe him of ſtupidity little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from folly? This nevertheleſs is what all men do; and it is likewiſe the only ſecret they have found to make themſelves happy. They ſee every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Image of their own ſelves, I mean of their own proper faults<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in thoſe of others, and yet they will not acknowledge them. To be full of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and not to ſee them, to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of our faults when no body elſe is, to be the Subject of moſt peoples laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and not willing to know any thing of it; to feed our ſelves with vain Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations being unwilling to know that they are vain, is a condition which doth not ſeem very deſirable; and yet it is this which is the delight of worldly men, and chiefly of the great ones.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. 'Tis by theſe means we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted from ſeeing the Truth, when we ſhould uſe ſome care and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110487:15"/>to find it. But there are ſome ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters wherein Truth ſhews it ſelf to us, and in which we ſhould be forced to ſee it, if we did not uſe Cunning to avoid it. For ſome times we find men Charitable enough to try to free us from the deluſions wherein we live in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our ſelves self-love therefore endeavours to baniſh this inconvenience, wants not yet the way to proſper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For it expreſſes ſo much Melancholy and evil humour to thoſe who would do us this good Office; it finds ſo many pretences not to believe what is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us of our faults; it is ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious to find out ſome greater in thoſe who obſerve ours, and to make the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are made to our diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage paſs for wicked, that there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any body will hazard to tell them us.</p>
                  <p>The general Principle that ſelf-love inſpires us with is, That we condemn nothing in us by a motive of Equity and Juſtice. So when any one ſhews that he does not approve of us in every thing, we attribute to him the <hi>Idea</hi> of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of jealouſie, or ſome other leſs favourable. And as no body loves to be looked ſo upon, there is formed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110487:16"/>amongſt men a kind of Conſpiration to diſſemble the opinions which they have one of another, and there is no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is better preſerved then that, becauſe it is grounded upon the ſentiment of ſelf-love, from which few or none are exempt.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. We muſt not think that men do not take care to hide the Truth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of thoſe whom they fear, or from whom they hope ſomething. They do the ſame almoſt in reſpect of all the World.</p>
                  <p>Men apply themſelves more to deceive great men, but they do not apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to undeceive thoſe of meaner qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. This is all the difference that's made between the one and the other. They love not to be hated by any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo they do not love to tell truth to any one. They know on the contrary that to make it be received there ſhould be many niceties, moderations, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtudied inventions. Now men will not take this pains for people they do not value. So we do not tell the Truth to Perſons of Quality, becauſe it is not our intereſt to do it. Nor to thoſe of meaner degree becauſe we have not Intereſt enough to tell it them.</p>

                  <p n="19">19. This reſerve that men keep amongſt themſelves in avoiding the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the thoughts they have to the diſadvantage of one another, is not nevertheleſs without Limits. And there is reaſon ſometimes which perſuades them to diſpence therewith. There needs alſo often but a little provocation to noiſe abroad on a ſuddain what we had kept ſecret for a long time. And moreover we have not been reſerved in this manner, but in ſpeaking to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons themſelves, whoſe faults were known to us. But that which we diſſembled in their preſence, we ſpeak ordinarily more freely in their abſence, as we have had then more trouble to refrain. It is true we govern our ſelves a little more reſervedly in reſpect of thoſe who can hurt us, and we uſe more precaution to diſcover what men think of them. But as it is an unſufferable Conſtraint to hide always theſe our ſentiments, the deſire which we have to free our ſelves from them makes us eaſily put on Confidence enough to truſt thoſe to whom we ſpeak, and that there wants little or no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to incline us to declare our ſelves with freedom.</p>
                  <p>Now although theſe wicked Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110487:17"/>which happen ſo often in the diſcourſes men make, are in themſelves a very great evil, ſeeing that whereas Charity doth oblige to tell Perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their faults, to give them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by means to Correct them, and to hide them from others, to favour them we do ordinarily quite contrary, and ſpeak of theſe faults to all the world, except to thoſe to whom it ſhould be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſpeak of them. There might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen nevertheleſs from thence ſome good, if we had a care to profit thereby. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, theſe particular diſcourſes ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves by little and little, and forming a publick Clamour, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns often thereby ſomething to the ears of them it concerns, becauſe there are many found, who, having not Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Force enough to tell themſelves what they think, are glad to be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereof by attributing it to others. It would be then a means for thoſe to whom it is diſcovered to draw them out of that Deluſion wherein they live. But we have ſuch deceitful hearts, and ſo full of averſion from any thing of Truth, that we abuſe very often this means, and render it uſeleſs to our ſelves. For inſtead of judging of theſe diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110487:17"/>and theſe opinions by which we are detracted as we ought they are ſpread abroad amongſt an infinite number of perſons, and ſo we have not right to complain thereof to any particular bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the inclination we have to deceive ourſelves cauſeth us to turn all our malice againſt him who is charged therewith; We perſuade our ſelves that he is ſingle in his opinion; that he hath not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred thereupon, but through hate or intereſt, and that there is no man of ſenſe and reaſon who does not condemn it. We attribute to him likewiſe ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, or ſome exceſs for pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more right to reject thoſe advices, and by the means of this voluntary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions we ſtifle the impreſſion which theſe diſcourſes might imprint in us, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our ſelves in the eſteem we have of our ſelves, and we avoid in ſome ſort ſeeing what the world diſapproved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an object or ſpectacle which vanity is not able to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. I have ſaid that we ſhunt it in ſome ſort, becauſe we do not ſhun it abſolutely. Truth always makes it ſelf a little light through all thoſe Clouds wherewith men ſtrive to obſcure it: there paſs always ſome rayes which incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110487:18"/>Pride, and which trouble this falſe quiet which it endeavors to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it ſelf. Theſe opinions, which are grounded only upon a voluntary error, are never firm and ſure. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mixed with Miſtruſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with melancholy, trouble, and moleſtation. So inſtead of this pure Joy, and this full and entire ſatisfaction which ſelf-love aimeth at, all it can do with all its wiles is to ſuſpend for ſome time the ſentiments of ſadneſs, which are nouriſhed at the bottom of the heart, and which are always ready to ſeize thereon.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Theſe are the natural ſentiments of Self-love, and the addreſſes it makes uſe of to conceal our faults, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der people from telling us of them. And it is remarkable that as it is in it ſelf a very great fault not to ſee the truth, ſo Self-love does not allow it no more than others. Self-love does not uſe leſs artifice to diſguiſe it to others then to our ſelves. And therefore we ſee few or none who do not eſteem it an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to love truth, and who do grant ſincerely that they are not at quiet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be diſcovered to them. We are offended with this reproach as much as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110487:18"/>with any other, and in a word, we would have the glory to love Truth, and the ſatisfaction never to hear it.</p>
                  <p>But as theſe two Paſſions in ſome ſort do not hold together, we endeavor to accord them in giving ſomething to the one and to the other. It is true, that as it is Self-love which cauſeth this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, ſo it makes it very unequal. For it brings it about that we are never told of thoſe eſſential faults, to which we are inclined by a quick and active Paſſion; that we diſſemble to thoſe which get us ill will from men, and which would give occaſion to deſpiſe our ſelves, and to believe that 'tis with reaſon that others do ſlight us. All the liberty therefore that we give to others upon this ſubject, is to mind us of ſome ſmall faults, which do not disfigure the Image we have of our ſelves, and which ſuffers the whole beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof to remain. <hi>Velut ſi egregio Impreſſos reprehendas Corpore naevos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So we ſuffer men to declare their opinions of a Diſcourſe, or of a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which we have made to find fault therein with ſome expreſſions not very Juſt, ſome bad Cadence, ſome place neglected; conditionally nevertheleſs that they eſteem the deſign of it; the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110487:19"/>Judgment, the Oeconomy, and the other more eſſential parts. We pardon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thoſe who advertiſe us of ſome want of reſpect, of management and other trifles of this nature, provided they do not touch upon our principal Paſſions, and that all they obſerve in us may ſubſiſt with the eſteem and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the generality. 'Tis on theſe Conditions, and at this rate we reſolve with our ſelves ſometimes to purchaſe glory, love truth, and give it ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; yet it muſt be Self-love which opens it to it, and that it be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with teſtimonies of eſteem and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection not to be ſlighted.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. In the ſecond Part we ſhall ſpeak more particularly of the ways men uſe to hinder that truth trouble them not, in the eſteem and love of themſelves. But what we have already ſaid may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſhew that we extend too much thoſe common Maxims, that men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally love truth, that they have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral averſion for what is falſe, and that there being an Infinite of perſons who would deceive others, there are none at all who would be deceived; ſeeing that it appears on the contrary, that the world is almoſt compoſed of nothing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:110487:19"/>but wilful blind people, who hate and fly the light, and who labour for nothing more than to deceive themſelves, and to entertain themſelves in deluſion. Where is then this love of Truth, wherewith we flatter our ſelves, and what hatred for falſity may be found in men who according to Scripture ſeek nothing elſe?</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Nevertheleſs, we may ſay that theſe Maxims have place in things Indifferent, in which men taking no Intereſts at all, do not in effect love to be deceived, and prefer truth before falſity. The which ſhews ſome natural love for Truth. But it is ſeldom ſeen that this natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is free to act, and that the mind is not prepoſſeſſed with ſome Paſſion which makes it incline more to one ſide than to another. There needs ſcarcely any thing to make Self-love to deliberate. It makes private and ſecret Intereſts even things wherein it ſeems to have none at all. The leaſt advance, the leaſt engagements, the leaſt inclination to pleaſe or to diſpleaſe ſuffice to take away the ballance, and to incline the minds, to ſeek out reaſons only on one ſide: How many are there, for example, who have no reaſon to continue in an
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:110487:20"/>opinion, but becauſe there would be ſome trouble to examin the Contrary reaſons. They fly the pains of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, becauſe it is laborious: They will judge, and decide, becauſe they will appear Learned, and to ſatisfie at once theſe two inclinations they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe without other examination that what they have formerly learn'd is true. <hi>Taedio novae Curae ſemel placita pro aeternis ſervant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. The chief and principal uſe we make of this love of truth, is, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us that what we love is true. For if we would do our ſelves Juſtice, we ſhould acknowledge that we love not things becauſe they are true, but that we believe them true, becauſe we love them. Our minds are fixed to objects Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant of their truth, and by the ſole relation of theſe Inclinations. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot enjoy them, if they look upon them as falſe, they endeavor in ſome ſort to add thereto the Idea of truth, that they may be fixed thereunto more firmly. <hi>Quicunque aliud amant,</hi>

                     <hi>hoc quod amant volunt eſſe veritalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. We love truth in general as the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110487:20"/>common and general good. For as we can love nothing which we do not think good, likewiſe we can love nothing which we believe not to be true. But Self-love knows very well how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join theſe general Inclinations with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Paſſions; And as it makes us believe that what we love is good, it makes us likewiſe believe that what we love is true; that is to ſay; we cannot love what is falſe under its proper and natural form, and loving in effect many falſe and deceitful objects, it finds means to repreſent them under the image of truth.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. This averſion ſo uniform and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is found amongſt men, for the truth which diſcovers them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and this inclination ſo general of ſhunning the ſight of their faults, as their greateſt misfortune gives way to believe that this common Maxim which calls them back to themſelves, and makes them to know themſelves, <hi>Noſce teipſum,</hi> proceeds not from a common light perſuading them that this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is for their good, and which makes them deſire it, but that it may well have its ſource in the knowledge of every mans heart, who feeling himſelf incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:110487:21"/>with the vanity, and the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice which he obſerves in others, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades him to ſeek and deſire for them, this knowledge which he neither ſeeks nor deſires for himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. This thought is ſo much more likely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as nothing ſhocks us more in the faults we obſerve in others, then the blindneſs wherein we ſee they are in regard of themſelves. What is there more troubleſome than a vain man who is taken up with nothing but himſelf, and who would have men only to apply themſelves to him, who admires himſelf continually, and who imagines that others do the ſame, or that they are to blame if they do not? And who is he who hath not a great inclination to tell perſons of this opinion, that they would do well to labor to know themſelves to draw themſelves out of thoſe deluſions wherein they are? <hi>Noſoe teipſum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. The World is full of people, who obſerve other mens faults with an admirable Judgment, who pardon them nothing, and who being ſubject to the ſame, or to greater faults themſelves, do not make the leaſt reflection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The vaineſt perſons moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laugh at other mens vanity. Thoſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:110487:21"/>who are Cheated, moſt laugh at thoſe whom they believe deceived. The moſt unjuſt reproach others of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice: The ſharpeſt men give ſweet leſſons; The moſt prejudiced perſons ſpeak earneſtly againſt prejudice: The moſt opiniated are the firſt in accuſing others of obſtinacy. It is very hard, not to have a deſire to adviſe theſe ſort of people that they ſpeak to themſelves in ſpeaking againſt others, and not to tell them at leaſt in their heart: <hi>Noſce teip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="29">29. When we ſee theſe ambitious men who heap enterprizes upon enterprizes, who form deſigns to which many lives would not ſatisfie, who trouble by their caprichios both their own and other mens quiet, who never dream of death which threatens them every moment, who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that others live, only for them, who devour with an inſatiable Covetouſneſs, other mens Goods. Who is it that does not find himſelf inclined to recal them to the knowledge of their mortal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and to make them mindful that they are but men?</p>
                  <p>We feel the ſame motions in an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rencounters, as when we ſee people, who for want of knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:110487:22"/>vndertake things infinitely above them, and in which they cannot proſper: who will do all becauſe they judge and think themſelves capable of all, and who ſpoil all by their want of parts; who glory in taking Counſels of no body; who complain to others of their bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that they have had by their impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. In fine, as the ignorance of ones ſelf is found almoſt in all vices, and is moſt what ſhocks us therein, we ſhould every moment endeavor to draw people out of their deluſion in teaching them to know themſelves, if this motive were not witheld by others more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. We have right methinks to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from what I ſaid but now, that this Precept, <hi>Know thou thy ſelf:</hi> in the mouth of thoſe who have acted only by ſelf-love was rather the effect of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and vexation, ſtirred up by the faults that they ſee in others, then by a clear ſight of the neceſſity of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for every man in particular, and for his proper good. We would have others to know themſelves, to the end they might act in a leſs ſhocking man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in regard of us: And yet we will not know our ſelves becauſe we will not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110487:22"/>ſee in our ſelves what thwarts us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nor think our ſelves obliged to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to correct ſome faults, in which we are very glad to continue. We find means to foſter our ſelves in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per deluſion, in fixing our thoughts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on certain objects, and hiding others from our ſelves. But we find the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of others very ridiculous, becauſe we ſee in them what they will not ſee therein, and clearly perceive the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are made of them, of which they ſee but a part. We do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear nevertheleſs to envy ſomething the condition of thoſe perſons ſo deceived, and to covet their place: But it is by fancying that if we were there we could avoid the faults we ſee in them, and that we could procure to our ſelves all that they wanted. And I know not if we would have it on condition to live in the ſame deluſion wherein we believe they do. For men have light enough not to believe others happy by the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of falſe wealth, and they are not capable to place their happineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but by baniſhing away the thought that it is falſe, and taking it for real.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. It is true, our underſtanding is not ſo blind but that having recall'd
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:110487:23"/>others by vexation to the knowledge of themſelves, it muſt conclude from thence in general, that it would be uſeful that every one ſhould know himſelf, and apply to himſelf this Precept in giving it to others. We are alſo very glad to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our ſelves in making a ſhew to be comprehended in the Precepts which we give to others. But theſe cold and ſpeculative applications are very far from forming an effective deſire to labour to acquire this knowledge, and laſtly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reaſons, which might carry or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us thereunto, are hardly able to make us ſurmount the natural diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we have thereunto. Whoſoever looks upon himſelf only in relation to this preſent life, is always unfortunate, be it that he do know or not know himſelf. He is more really ſo in not knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he is more ſenſibly ſo in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf; and the ſenſible carries him ordinarily to the real, becauſe it makes Impreſſion upon the ſenſes, whereas the inſenſible realities act only upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Now reaſon when it withſtands the inclinations of Self-love is not of very great uſe in the Conduct of life; and after all, Death which puts an end to all Imprudence, and all the wiſdom
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:110487:23"/>of men renders the advantage of the one above the other ſo inconſiderable, that it takes away the deſire of ſeeking eagerly: Which made <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay to expreſs this human opinion, <hi>That he hath ſaid in himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If I muſt die, what will it profit me to have applyed my ſelf to wiſdom?</hi> Every advantage which regards only this preſent life is hardly worth the pains we undergo to obtain it, becauſe this life is only an inſtant which deſerves not to be deliberated on.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. We ſhall not find then in our own nature any inclination which doth move it to apply its ſelf to the knowledge of its ſelf, nor ſufficient motives which can make it deſire: But if we add thereto the lights of faith, the neceſſity of this duty will appear ſo preſſing, that we ſhall have much ado to comprehend that there are any Chriſtians, who would live well in the ignorance of themſelves, and their eſtate. For this faith teaches us, that it is in vain that we fly and avoid knowing our ſelves, that this ſight is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable; ſeeing that God will open the eyes of all men that they may ſee themſelves ſuch as they are, but with this horrible difference, That thoſe who have been unwilling to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:110487:24"/>in this World, ſhall ſee whether they will or no themſelves everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a ſight which ſhall fill them with rage and deſpair; Whereas thoſe who have not avoided ſeeing themſelves in this life, and who have laboured by this means to deſtroy in themſelves what is diſpleaſing to God, ſhall hereafter ſee nothing which may not be joyful to them, or rather they ſhall forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happily for eternity, becauſe they will ſee nothing but God in themſelves and in all other Creatures. We have therefore only to chuſe either to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to know our ſelves in this World, or to be for ever our own proper tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By making tryal of this terrible Threat God pronounces againſt the wicked. <hi>Arguam te &amp; ſtatuam contra faciem tuam,</hi> I will reprehend thee, and will place thee before thy own face.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. What deſpair will that be of a miſerable Soul, who having avoided all her life ſeeing and knowing her ſelf, ſhall be at once fixed and glued to this object for all Eternity, without hope of ever being able to divert her ſelf for one ſingle moment, who ſhall have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before her eyes all her Crimes, not being able to deſtroy them, nor to avoid
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:110487:24"/>ſeeing them. This is the Inevitable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of this voluntary forgetfulneſs of ones ſelf. We muſt labour ſincerely either to know our ſelves during this life, or to know our ſelves eternally in the other in this horrible manner. There is no Mean, neither Reaſon nor Faith have doubtleſs any trouble to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. But as we are carried to this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs by a very violent weight, and which doth overpoiſe almoſt all the World, it is neceſſary to fortifie our Faith, and to maintain our Reaſon by all the conſiderations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us the advantages of this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as are theſe which ſhall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. We may ſay that as the not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ones ſelf is the ſource or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all vices, the knowledge thereof is the ground or foundation of virtues. And we need only conſider the nature of each Virtue to be perſuaded thereof. What means, for example, to be truly humble without knowing ones ſelf? or rather, what is humility but a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ones ſins, of ones miſeries, and of ones unworthineſs, which makes one abject in his own thoughts, and judge himſelf worthy of all ſorts of Abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:110487:25"/>This is the definition which St. <hi>Barnard</hi> gives thereof. <hi>Humilitas virtus eſt, quá homo veriſſimá ſui Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ſibi Ipſe vileſcit.</hi> The ſight of our faults is therefore the foundation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and 'tis at the ſame time that which preſerves it. 'Tis preſently loſt if we only obſerve our virtues whether they be true or falſe. Strange conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans Soul to whom ſickneſs it ſelf is neceſſary, that ſhe may not die! She is almoſt void of all good, and cannot ſee the little that remains without danger of looſing it.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. The knowledge of our ſelves doth not humble us ſimply in reſpect of God. It hinders us alſo that we do not raiſe our ſelves above our neighbor, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but the forgetfulneſs of our ſelves which is able to make us contemn and deſpiſe him. One ſick perſon never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults over another, but in forgetting his own ſickneſs, and as one is always full of ſweetneſs towards ones ſelf, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſeth others hardly but in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing himſelf from them. And this is it which the knowledge of our ſelves doth not permit us to do, ſeeing that it always diſcovers to us either the ſame faults in us, or the roots thereof, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110487:25"/>makes us feel the weight which we ſhould undergo if Gods grace did not permit it. Therefore the Apoſtle in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending us to reprove with ſweetneſs thoſe who ſin <hi>in ſpiritu lenitatis,</hi> recals us to the knowledge of our weakneſs, and the danger wherein we are of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling every moment: <hi>Ne &amp; tu tenteris.</hi> Behold the ſource of meekneſs, and of humility towards ones neighbor.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Man is ſo weak and ſo vain, that he is equally carryed to pride by the ſight of Virtue, which he thinks he hath, and by that of faults which he obſerves in others. By the one he raiſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own opinion above them. By the other he humbleth them and bringeth them under him. But the knowledge of ones ſelf preſerves both the one and the other; and in placing ones proper faults before ones eyes, it ſtifles on one part the compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency that it may have in his virtue, and it renders the other more Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to anothers faults. So it keeps him at leaſt at a level with other men: It teacheth him to bear them as he would be born with by them, and it makes alſo in ſome manner a good uſe of Self-love.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. The forgetfulneſs of ones ſelf
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:110487:26"/>produceth obdurateneſs, and by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect the knowledge of ones ſelf produceth Piety. For there is in the ſentiments of Compaſſion for others ſome ſecret reflections upon our ſelves, by which we look upon our ſelves either as having ſuffered the ſame evils, or as being liable to ſuffer them.</p>
                  <q>Non Ignara mali miſeris ſuccurrere diſco.</q>
                  <p>And it is this which makes men who believe they are above others, and who imagine the evils wherewith others are afflicted, cannot happen to them, are for the moſt part hard hearted, becauſe they make not upon themſelves theſe kind of reflections, which ſoften the heart in conſideration of anothers evil.</p>
                  <p>It is the ſame with the moſt part of Injuſtices we do to others. They come ordinarily from a blindneſs, which makes us never blame our ſelves, but think that we are exempt from all faults and miſdemeanors, we lay the blame all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others. So that nothing contributes ſo much to make us juſt and equitable towards others as the knowledge of our ſelves. 'Tis that makes us diſcover in the bottom of our hearts the impreſſion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110487:26"/>of the Law of nature which forbids us to do to others, what we would not they ſhould do to us. 'Tis that which diſperſes all the Clouds wherewith Self-love doth obſerve this rule in the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters wherein it is concerned. 'Tis this which hinders us likewiſe from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining with eagerneſs of the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous. Judgments men form of us, and of the injuſtices men may do us, in convincing us that oftentimes we deal ſo with others without taking care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In fine, 'tis this which ſuppreſſeth mens inſolence, and haughtineſs, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a very lively Image of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries before their eyes, deſtroys the moſt ordinary cauſe of injuſtices which they do to others.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. The ſight of our faults in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing our pride, ſuppreſſeth alſo the conſequences of it, and all the Paſſions wherewith it mingles it ſelf, and as there are few whereof it is not the ſource, there alſo few whereof this ſight is not the remedy. A man who knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well, is ſcarcely emulous, becauſe he is convinced that he deſerves nothing, and therefore he does not believe that the honor which is given to others is due to him.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:110487:27"/>
                  <p>He is neither ſharp nor vindicative, becauſe the ſmall eſteem that he hath of himſelf, doth not make him take or reckon the offences men do to him as things of moment.</p>
                  <p>He cannot hate any man, becauſe he cannot hate himſelf, and ſees neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nothing in others that he does not acknowledge in himſelf in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                  <p>He is not very ambitious, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not form deſigns to raiſe himſelf in the World, becauſe theſe deſigns ſpring from a belief we have that we deſerve the rank whereto we aſpire, and do think that we have more cunning and induſtry than others to arrive thereunto. Now a man who knows himſelf well, doth not flatter himſelf with theſe thoughts.</p>
                  <p>He does not conceive moreover this elevation as a great good. He perceives that theſe paſſions may render him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry miſerable in ſome condition. That his Covetouſneſs would exceed its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits more, if it had more means to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie is ſelf, and in the uncertainty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is, whether it would be good or bad for him, he eaſily concludes to keep himſelf in the places wherein he finds himſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:110487:27"/>
                  <p n="39">39. That Poverty which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath made the firſt of the Beatitudes, and which is praiſed in ſo many places in Scripture, is nothing elſe but an humble knowledge of ones ſelf. For to be poor in this manner, one muſt know that he is ſo, and able to ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Ego vir videns paupertatem tuam.</hi> That is to ſay, that we ought to know in us either the lack of goods which we have not, or the lack of all right to the goods which we hold from Gods liberality, which includes an entire knowledge of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. It is eaſie to comprehend how this knowledge doth make us more patient in reſpect of the evils which are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opinion; as unfavourable judgments which are made of us, calumnies, and falſities. For it is clear, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ought to leſſen the ſenſe thereof by the ſight it gives us of our effective miſery, which yet is much more great then all that man can ſay of it. But we do not ſee at firſt how this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our miſeries and faults may ſerve us to be more patient in outward evils, in loſſes, in diſgraces, in ſickneſs, in griefs. We might alſo believe that it would be a new Charge which would
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110487:28"/>only be proper to overwhelm the Soul by ſadneſs and deſpair. Yet it is not ſo, for if this ſight of our faults be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, 'tis a burthen which comforts one in all other afflictions; becauſe it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to us that they are Juſt, that they are proportioned to our Inward evils, and that they may ſerve as a remedy thereunto; that it convinces us that proſperity would not have been leſs dangerous then adverſity, and that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us leave to reflect upon all that is arrived to us in our life of good and evil, it makes us ſee that we have yet more abuſed our ſelves with good then evil, and that we are charged more ſtrictly therewith in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. It is yet eaſier to comprehend how much the knowledge of ones ſelf doth contribute to Prudence. For the moſt part of enterpriſes ill managed, and deſigns raſhly undertaken ſpring from the preſumption of thoſe who form them; and this preſumption comes from a blindneſs wherein they are in reſpect of themſelves. There is nothing more frequent then theſe indiſcretions in particular actions, and they all ſpring for the moſt part from the principal action of life which is the choice of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:110487:28"/>the State and Employment wherein every one ought to paſs his time. For it is this wherein the ignorance of our ſelves makes us to commit the greateſt faults.</p>
                  <p>There is no man ſo diſgraced by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture who cannot find in the order of the world a place proportioned to the ſtrength of his mind and body, but the ſmall knowledge which he hath of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is the cauſe that moſt people make a bad choice. Let us make reflection on thoſe who take upon them the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Employments of this World, and the places that they enjoy, and we ſhall ſcarcely find any one well placed. How many are there who having Arms and no Head do chuſe Employments which have need of a head and not of Arms? How many are there who being born to obey and not to govern do poſſeſs Places where there is need of Commanding and not of obeying? How many that ingage themſelves in Offices which are above their Sphear, their Power, and above their Virtue? and how few withdraw themſelves from them by the knowledge of their Incapacities? Every one thinks he is able, and only limits his pretentions by the debility
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110487:29"/>wherein he finds himſelf of being rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a higher pitch. This is the moſt common Source of worldly diſorders, and of the Evils that befall both Church and State, and likewiſe of each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. For 'tis not poſſible that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ill placed, and who wants ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualities to acquit himſelf of the Employment wherein he is engaged, ſhould not commit a world of faults, and theſe faults which are the ſequels of his temerity and preſumption do render him ridiculous in this World, and everlaſtingly miſerable in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. The ſole knowledge of ones ſelf may ſupply the defect of Talents, and the ſole defect of this knowledge on the contrary renders all theſe Talents uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, dangerous, and pernicious to him who hath them. 'Tis no great harm to have neither Memory, Underſtanding, Conduct, Science, Induſtry, nor Ability, provided that one know it; Let him borrow of ſome other what he hath not, and undertake nothing which requires thoſe qualities which God hath not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to beſtow upon him. A man with all theſe Imperfections, in applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only to that which is proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:110487:29"/>to his ability, is Praiſe worthy, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he may become a Saint, and that he is often more acceptable to God then thoſe who have all the qualities which he wants? He is only deprived of them for a Moment, that is, for this preſent life, and he hath as much right as any man to hope he may be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of them in the other. But let us ſuppoſe all theſe Talents in one man, and as much light and underſtanding as we will, if with theſe he does not know himſelf in his imperfections, and in his weakneſſes, all theſe qualities with prove only his fall and ruin, and often alſo in this world. If he cannot meaſure his enterpriſes by his forces, he will enter into raſh engagements and preſumption which hath no boundaries, not being check'd by the Rains of the knowledge of ones ſelf, will carry him away to dangerous exceſſes.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. One may add to theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſons this general one which ought to make more Impreſſion upon our minds and add thereto more horrour of this blindneſs, That as the common puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Condemned in the other life will be to ſee themſelves, <hi>Arguam te, &amp; ſtatuam contra faciem tuam,</hi> the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:110487:30"/>general Character of the Condemned in this here is not to ſee themſelves; ſo that it is equally true that we enter not into heaven unleſs we know our ſelves, and into hell becauſe we do not know our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The death of ſin which is the cauſe of eternal death is accompanied always with a kind of misfortunate drouſineſs which deprives us of the knowledge of our condition, and therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet earneſtly beſeeched God, <hi>That he would enlighten his eyes to the end that he might not ſleep in Death,</hi> becauſe he knew very well that this death was inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from that drowſineſs, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he did not ſleep he ſhould not dye. <hi>Illumina occulos meos, ne unquam obdormiam in morte.</hi> The State that ſin reduceth man to is ſo horrible that he would not ſuffer it, if he ſaw it but, and ſo men whom Pleaſure draws there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto find means to hide it from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a thouſand Inventions which they are miſerably ingenious to find out.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. One of the moſt criminal ones and yet the commoneſt is to ſtifle in ones ſelf the ſight which condemus theſe diſorders, in juſtifying them to their face<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:110487:30"/>by falſe Rules which authoriſeth them. 'Tis the Origin of ſo many Errors in Morality, and of ſo many bad Maxims which men have always endeavoured to introduce into the Church, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in theſe latter times. For men not being willing to render their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons conform to the Law of God, have endeavoured to render the Laws of God conform to their actions. In ſtead of redreſſing their corrupt Inclinations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exactneſs of this Divine rule, they have endeavoured to ſtrain this rule, even to adjuſt it to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. They will not only follow their own Intereſts and Paſſions, but they will alſo be approved in their Intereſts and Paſſions, nor will they permit that their Conſciences reproach them of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unjuſt. So that things not Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their expectation in the Maxims which God hath given us for our guide, if they did leave them in their Purity, they have endeavoured to alter them, to find therein this approbation which they ſeek, and to appeaſe by this means the trouble of their Conſcience. 'Tis thus that by the favour of theſe falſe lights, which they willingly take for true ones, they ſettle themſelves in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="45">45. What if they cannot ſucceed to hide entirely this light which condemns them, they have recourſes to other means to weaken the effect of it, and to hinder the Impreſſion which it would be able to make upon them. Sometimes in letting the Law ſubſiſt, they are contented not to think of it, never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their actions therewith, nor ever looking on them unleſs with contrary faces, which do not repreſent to them what they have defective. If they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtop the ſight of this oppoſition en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely which they have to the Laws of God, they weaken and diminiſh the <hi>Idea</hi> of it in joyning themſelves to an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite of people which they condemn as well as themſelves, as if this croud of Criminals was capable to defend them againſt God: Laſtly, if they do not diſguiſe the Laws of God, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, themſelves to themſelves. They attribute to themſelves motives and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions which the have not, and will not ſee thoſe they have.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have endeavoured in the firſt Part of this Treatiſe, only to make the knowledge of ones ſelf deſired. We ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in this here that deſire quite formed and joined to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere reſolution of labouring to acquire this knowledge. There is nothing more to be done but to put thoſe who are ſo well diſpoſed, into the way that leads to it, and to open to them the moſt proper means to attain thereunto; And we may firſt tell them that this deſire is one of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110487:32"/>the Principalleſt of them, and that it would ſuffice to produce this effect if it were full and entire. For there is this difference betwixt this knowledge and that of objects which are out of us, we may be ignorant of other things, how deſirous ſoever we may be to know them, but we continue not in the ignorance of our ſelves, but only becauſe we do not deſire abſolutely to forſake it, and we nouriſh in the bottom of our hearts a ſecret diſowning of truth. It is this which in us oppoſes the light of God, and hinders it from penetrating our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. Without that it would make us ſee clearly into all the foulds of our hearts; it would advertiſe us of all our dangers, and we ſhould have need of no other thing to make us know our ſelvés perfectly, but to expoſe our ſelves to theſe Divine beans.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have ſhewn in the firſt Part that this miſerable Inclination was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come natural to man ſince ſin, and we muſt add here, that grace never deſtroys it abſolutely, and that whatſoever deſire it inſpires us with not to blind our ſelves, there reſts always as we may ſay in the bottom of the old man an inclination towards this voluntary blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110487:33"/>which is obſerved by theſe words of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man who does ill,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Omnis qui male agit odit lucem non ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit ad lucem ut non mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtentur ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ejus.</note> 
                     <hi>hates the light, and comes not to the light, that his works may not be known.</hi> For as there is no man who doth not incline to evil, conſequently there is none who hath not ſome averſion for the light which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it to him.</p>
                  <p>But alſo as that inclination to evil, which ſin hath imprinted in out Souls, doth not hinder God from Imprinting therein, by his grace, a contrary Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which inclines us to Good and to Juſtice, This natural diſowning which we have of Truth hinders not God from breathing into us a contrary Inclination, which makes us love and ſearch Truth. We are only obliged to acknowledge that our heart is divided, That we love not abſolutely truth, that there are two oppoſite weights and inclinations in us, ſo that if we have reaſon to give thanks to God becauſe he hath given us ſome love for Truth, we have alſo reaſon to humble our ſelves in beholding our ſelves, according to this other inclination, as Enemies to this ſame Truth.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:110487:33"/>
                  <p n="3">3. There is nothing that makes us better to comprehend the greatneſs of mans diſorder then the ſight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Propenſity we feel in our ſelves. For God being the Truth, the Light, the Juſtice; to hate the Light, the Truth, the Juſtice, is to hate God himſelf. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs man hates them. He would gladly that this Truth were not, that this light were extinguiſhed, and that this Juſtice were aboliſht; that is to ſay he would that there were no God. He wiſheth that there were an annihilation of it, and not being able to deſtroy it in his proper being, he deſtroys it as much as he can for himſelf by ſhutting his eyes againſt the ſight of Truth.</p>
                  <p>Behold that condition in which we are not only born, but wherein yet we are partly engaged, and from whence we ought to endeavour to free our ſelves by leſſening as much as we ſhall be able this natural averſneſs we have for Truth, and by labouring to encreaſe in us what God hath given us of love for it. It is good to exerciſe our ſelves more about this work to convince our ſelves of the weakneſs of this love. We may eaſily do it in conſidering how much a perfect and ſincere love, of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:110487:34"/>which the heart is poſſeſſed, as is that of an Uſurer for his money, is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the love we have, or that we flatter our ſelves to have for the Truth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. An Uſurer inclines continually to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gain; the means that are given him thereof enter always without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, they are alway received with a ſincere Joy, and without oppoſition. There needs no ſtudied management nor moderation to make them agreeable. Every man is welcome to propoſe them Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Inferiors, Equals, Superiors; and he is far from conceiving any bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs againſt thoſe who make him any Overture to encreaſe his Wealth, it would be a certain means to ſweeten him if he were angry at them. He does not amuſe himſelf in finding out reaſons to reject theſe advices, nor ever takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to examin the defects of thoſe who give them. He is not ſcrupulous in manners, in the behaviour, in the intentions. He only ſeeks to aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the truth of what hath been told him, and examining it ſincerely, he fears nothing but being deceived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:110487:34"/>
                  <p>Behold in what manner we ought to love Truth, and the Model the Wiſe Man propoſeth to us, in ordering us to ſeek it as Money; and we may ſee there that we love it ſo little and ſeek it ſo imperfectly, that the contrary to what we have ſaid of this Uſurer may be ſaid of us.</p>
                  <p>For our hearts are hardly ever open on that ſide Truth preſents it ſelf. It finds there always reſiſtance, and never enters but by violence and force; and if ſometimes it be in appearance grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received, it is always with ſome inward remorſe of ſome ſuperficial joy, with which we diſtinguiſh it. No man is proper to make us know it, and ſelf-love is almoſt never wanting to furniſh us with Reproaches againſt thoſe who undertake it. Rhetorick hath neither Cunning nor delicateneſs enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate it without hurting us. We allways find exceſs in the things, defects in the Grace, in the manner, and in the time; and in ſtead of applying our mind ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to the examination of what is propoſed to us, we apply it only in an unprofitable ſearch of their defects who have given theſe Counſels. This is the protraiture of the Spirit, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:110487:35"/>of the moſt part of men. The lineaments are more obſerved in ſome then in others, but there are very few in whom ſome foot-ſteps of them do not appear.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. At leaſt let us not flatter our ſelves with a Virtue which we have not, and let us beware of ſaying, as many do, <hi>That we deſire nothing ſo much as to know our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>that they can do us no greater pleaſure then to help us therein.</hi> Let us on the contrary acknowledge that it would be to give to our ſelves a Praiſe which ſurpaſſeth man, and which could be nothing but the effect of our Vanity and our Blindneſs: So that the firſt ſtep we ſhall make to get out of it is to acknowledge ſincerely the oppoſition we feel in our ſelves againſt this ſelf knowledge, and to weep for it before God as being one of our greateſt misfortunes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſecond ſtep which is no leſs eſſential is to acknowledge the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility we have of proſpering in this ſearch, without the aſſiſtance of Gods light. Becauſe there is only this light which is able to diſſipate the Cloud which cover our hearts, and it is only by means of it that we are capacitated
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:110487:35"/>to Judg truly of what we diſcover there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, our motions being good or bad as they are for or againſt Truth, which is the rule of them. Laſtly, there is none but God who can give us a knowledge of our ſelves, which is moderate to the juſt proportion our Infirmity requires, that which we are able to procure purely by human force, being ſometimes as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as the ignorance it ſelf of our State and Condition, becauſe it is able to diſcourage the Soul, and bring her to a kind of Diſpair, whereas that which God gives her, upholds her at the ſame time that the other dejects her, and never ſhrinks back at the ſight of of her miſeries, but is raiſed again by hope in the mercy of God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But this perſuaſion, That we ought not to expect this knowledge ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry except from the pure Grace of God, doth in no manner exclude the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we muſt make to obtain it. For Grace is often hid under theſe reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and makes uſe thereof to make theſe lights enter into our minds. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt act in reſpect of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Point of Chriſtian life as in all others. That is to ſay, we muſt demand it of God as dependant on him only,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:110487:36"/>and labour to get it as if it did depend only on our care: And it is in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that we ſhall give here ſome Overtures which may be uſeful in this Enquiry.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. There are two ſorts of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of man, the one general, the other particular. The firſt diſcovers what happens to all men in the ſtate of ſin wherein they are born; the other teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us what we have added to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Corruption. Becauſe though it may be the ſame in all at the Root, it takes nevertheleſs infinite ſeveral Shapes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as the Soul forſakes them more or leſs, and that Concupiſcence being limited and excited by occaſions and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, diffuſeth it ſelf more on the one ſide then the other, ſo that by this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent mixture of particular diſorders, it forms it ſelf as many ſeveral Diſeaſes and Conditions, as there are different Souls.</p>
                  <p>It is, without doubt, to this particular knowledge of our condition that we ought to incline. For it would help little or nothing to contemplate the general Portraiture of the corruption of Nature, if we make not uſe of it to trace out our own, ſeeing that it may
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:110487:36"/>be a means to cure us particularly, and not men generally. But the knowledge of the common condition of men is nevertheleſs very uſeful; and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends likewiſe the greateſt part of this particular knowledge which we ſeek. For theſe defects and theſe Vices do not ceaſe, for being common, to be the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the Defects of each of us; they ſubſiſt not in the Air, nor in ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparated from us.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110487:37"/>all become Mortal, theſe ſame which ſeem almoſt Cured being able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame themſelves afreſh by divers inward and outward cauſes ſufficient to produce this effect, this man having no means or force to hinder it. Behold the Image of the State wherein we are born, and what we are by Nature. The love of our ſelves which is the Center and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all our Maladies gives us a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent inclination for Pleaſures, for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, for all that doth nouriſh our Curioſity, to fill up thereby the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vacuity which the loſs of our true happineſs hath cauſed in our hearts. And this Inclination diſpoſes us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure theſe three objects of our deſires by all ſorts of means, how unjuſt and how criminal ſoever they may be.</p>
                  <p>But as theſe objects are changed a thouſand ways, acting more or leſs upon our imaginations and our ſenſes, the motives by which the Soul is ſwayed thereto are alſo very different: And it is that which makes the variety of our paſſions. Therefore the divers aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings and the ſeveral degrees make the difference of the particular humors and diſpoſitions of men. Some are more Criminal others more Innocent accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110487:37"/>to their objects; ſome more lively, others more languiſhing, according as they behave themſelves. There are ſome likewiſe which appear abſolutely extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, becauſe the heart is Lorded over by a contrary Paſſion. And theſe are the wounds without inflammation; and almoſt cured, whereof we were ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even now. But we muſt not rely thereon abſolutely; For they never are ſo well cloſed up but that they may be venomed again. How far ſoever we may be from certain Vices, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains always nevertheleſs in us inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough to make us fall therein, if God did permit that the thoughts which might diſſuade us ſhould be taken away from our mind, that the objects which might incline us thereunto ſhould act lively upon us, and laſtly that there ſhould be a heap of outward Circumſtances able to provoke our Concupiſcence, and to turn it on that ſide, which hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to eſtabliſh this fine Rule, <hi>That of all the ſins that men commit, there is not one that another man would not commit, if he were not aſſiſted by Him who made Man. Nullum Peecatum facit homo, quod non facit alius homo, ſi non adjuvet Rector a quo factus eſt homo,</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="10">10. Let us therefore never flatter our ſelves with a clear exemption from any vices, and acknowledge in us this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate aptneſs to all the Crimes and diſorders of men. Let this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never permit us to raiſe our ſelves above any one whomſoever. Let it hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us by all the diſorders and by all the defects which we ſhall obſerve in others, being that they are ours in ſome ſort by an inclination we have thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and by an impoſſibility we are in of ſecuring our ſelves from them unleſs God preſerve us. Thus the Hiſtory of man which comprehends almoſt nothing but that of their Paſſions, their weakneſs, and their diſorders, will in ſome ſort become our own Hiſtory; and whereas it is for the moſt part of people only a vain and idle recreation, it will be for us, if we will conſider it in this ſenſe, a very ſolid Inſtruction, which will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſet our faults before our eyes, and make us acknowledge either that which we are really, or what we may come to if God leave us to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. It is by theſe reflections which we ought to make without intermiſſion upon all we ſee, and learn by mens diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, that we muſt endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:110487:38"/>more diſtinctly the corruption of our nature. For it does not Juſtifie to have only a confuſed and a general <hi>Idea</hi> of it, like thoſe we have already drawn. We muſt conſider particularly the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts and the effects that depend thereon, and ſtrive to know throughly the injuſtice, the vanity, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the nature of man, the progreſs and the effects of his Paſſions, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying our ſelves always to theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon knowledges, and not contenting our ſelves to acknowledge ſimply that we have the Root and the Source of theſe defects, endeavour moreover to diſcover what theſe Roots have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in us, and even to what degree they are living.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But as the diſorder and Injuſtice of man are only deprivations of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wherein he ought to be, and of the Juſtice in which he ought to remain firm, it is clear that it cannot be known as it ought to be, whileſt we are ignorant of this Order and this Juſtice, that is to ſay, of the Divine and Eternal Laws which rule and govern mens Duties, and from whence they cannot be ſeperated without falling into diſorder and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. But it is not here in this place
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:110487:39"/>that we intend to treat of it throughly, it is rather the ſubſtance abſolutely of Morality then of a ſmall Writing like this here; and we will content our ſelves to propoſe in general ſome advices to avoid in the ſtudy we muſt make all our lives, the voluntary digreſſions, and the crafty and ſubtil fetches wherein the averſion for Truth doth ingage us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to our ſelves, or rather without acknowledging that we were aware of them.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Amongſt the Rules which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe mens Duties, and concerning which they ſhall be judged, there are ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, as for Example, that Murder, Theft, Adultery, Fornication, Falſe witneſſes, are actions very Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and others on the contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which there is ſome difference betwixt thoſe who engage themſelves in the deciding theſe kind of queſtions.</p>
                  <p>I do not by this difference pretend to take away the certainty and evidence of theſe conteſted Rules. For I know that there are ſome which are no leſs clear and certain then Principles the moſt generally received by all men, and of which Rules there is no doubt but by miſtake of application or by blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:110487:39"/>of Paſſion and Malice. I will only mark the fact, and diſtinguiſh the truths of Morality in theſe two Claſſes, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation not to their real evidence, but to the effective diſpoſition of men, who have embraced the one unanimouſly, and who are divided in regard of the other.</p>
                  <p>I place likewiſe in the ſame rank with theſe conteſted Rules thoſe, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though little oppugn'd by writings and diſcourſe, are nevertheleſs by practice, and which many who would paſs and be thought to lead a Chriſtian-like life, do not forbear to violate by their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; not ceaſing, for all that, to find out Confeſſors who do tolerate them, or who do approve them, and without looſing the eſteem of Perſons who are very regular. There are, for example, very few Confeſſors who would autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, by a formal deciſion, Balls, Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Romances, the immodeſt manner Women dreſs themſelves in now a days, the uſe that is made commonly of the Goods belonging to the Church, the ſeeking after Eccleſiaſtical Dignities. Nevertheleſs ſeeing that ſo many, who have ſome Conſcience, make no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all theſe things, there muſt needs
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:110487:40"/>be Confeſſors who find nothing to ſay againſt them, and who believe them not obliged to forſake them.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Whoſoever deſires to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ought to be Inſtructed and well Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe two kind of Truths, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is thereby that he ought to judge of himſelf and his condition. And it is very eaſie to do it in the reſpect of the firſt; becauſe there's no need but that we ſeriouſly wiſh it. Theſe truths are expoſed to all thoſe who deſire to be informed of them; they are to be found every where. But if it is eaſie to learn them after a ſpeculative manner, it is not ſo eaſie to make uſe of them as a light to diſcover the very bottom of the heart, and to judge of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Becauſe ſelf-love, which cannot hinder them always from entring into the memory, acts ſo that they continue fruitleſs therein, that is to ſay, that they never ſerve for Rules to us, that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver compare our action with them, that we never draw the moſt natural and certain conſequences from them, that they never come into our mind but when we are compelled to diſcourſe of them; and laſtly that we look upon them not different from thoſe opinions of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:110487:40"/>ancient Philoſophers, which we are glad to keep as a Pledge in our memory as points of knowledge and erudition, but by which we do not think to rule our lives.</p>
                  <p>This diſpoſition of our hearts muſt be conſidered as one of our greateſt miſcheifs, making Truth, which ſhould be the remedy, to ſerve only to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them by the bad uſage we make of its light. For not being given us but as our Guide, we become unjuſt Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it, when we do not uſe it for this end. We ought therefore to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt all means to remedy this evil; and ſo how remote ſoever we may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin our ſelves from truth, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that we force our ſelves to draw near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to it, and make uſe of it as a Torch to ſearch in the moſt hidden corners of our ſoul all that may be contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But if ſelf-love have ſubtilty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſtop in the moſt part of the world the effect of the moſt conſtant Truths, and whereof we are the moſt convinced, it does yet ſhift off more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily thoſe which are diſputed, either by contrary opinions formally maintained, or by an oppoſite practice. For it is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:110487:41"/>the cauſe either that people, remaining in a doubt, do nevertheleſs act as if they were very certain of what they muſt believe in that diſagreement of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or that they do define for that party which favoureth their inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by ſo frivilous reaſons that they are aſhamed to tell them when they are obliged, or that they blindly follow the example of others, without ſo much as ever examining whether this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be ſatisfactory or not, or whether they may be freed from it before God in alledging to him that they have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the common tract; and at laſt they know ſo well how to ſtop in this point their curioſity, that they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend nothing more then to ſee it too clearly.</p>
                  <p>It is not my deſign to decide here any of theſe points which I have called Conteſted, becauſe there may be found perſons in the Church who oppoſe them, either as their opinions, or a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them. I ſay only that the quiet wherein thoſe live who follow ſome baſe opinions without ever having examined them ſeriouſly, is viſibly unreaſonable, and cannot come except from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the heart, from a hatred for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:110487:41"/>Truth, and from a deſire which they have to ſatisfie their Paſſions, not being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for it by remorſe of Conſcience; and laſtly from a fear of being obliged to Condemn themſelves in reſpect of the time paſt, and to change their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living for the time to come. 'Tis that which ſtifles their fear, and hinders them from having, in regard of their Salvation, the ſame Sentiments which they approved in regard of all other things. If ſome able Phiſicians did tell them that ſuch certain meats were poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, they would willingly abſtain from eating of them, before they were aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that theſe Phiſicians were miſtaken. If they had notice given them, That there was a Deſign of taking away their lives, that the houſes were on Fire, they would give little or no belief to thoſe who ſhould tell them the contrary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bringing them very good proof; they would not be wanting to dive into the bottom of theſe advices, nor could they be at quiet with themſelves until they ſhould be abſolutely cleared of the truth thereof. From whence happens it then that when they hear that rational and underſtanding perſons are convinced, That ſome things they practice are not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:110487:42"/>permitted, that they are capable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, that they are Condemned by the Law of God, as being Crimes, they are nevertheleſs ſo little moved thereat, that all ſeems to aſſure them? From whence comes it that they take ſo little pains to examin to the bottom the occaſion of this Judgment or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which is againſt them, or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe any of thoſe who are perſwaded of it, but that they ſtop at certain ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial reaſons, and that provided they ſee themſelves Authorized by a Rabble, whom other times they eſteem very little either for Judgment or Piety, they think they have nothing to fear? Who ſees not that 'tis their Paſſion that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends their Reaſon, and hides from them the moſt common rules of Senſe, which they cannot hinder themſelves from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if they were not as it were tyed by their heart, which fears to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed in its Inclinations?</p>
                  <p>That which we ought to do to avoid this diſorder ſo viſible and ſo proper to caſt us into, and keep us in blindneſs, is to eſtabliſh, for an inviolable Principle of our Conduct, never to follow in the practical any of thoſe opinions favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the inclination of Nature, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:110487:42"/>which are condemned by able men, unleſs we be fully aſſured that theſe men be deceived, and in an exceſs of ſecurity. Otherwiſe we ſhall not be able to free our ſelves from raſhneſs, and the unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Acts which we commit by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Rule ſo prepoſterous ought to be a warning for us that we deceive not our ſelves even in the bottom, and that 'tis the averſion we have for Truth that hinders us from acknowledging it.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. It would not be ſufficient to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in the knowledge of ones ſelf to be only inſtructed in the Principles of Truth, by which we ought to judge of our Actions, and of our State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Becauſe, provided that we had never ſo little Sincerity to make the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it, 'twould not be poſſible at leaſt that our groſs faults ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main abſolutely unknown to us. But to form to our ſelves the <hi>Idea</hi> which ought to be had thereof, there muſt be added to the knowledge of Gods Laws that of his Grandeur, of his Bounty the infinite obligations we have to him, the Right which he hath over men in quality of Creator and Redeemer. There muſt be added the neceſſary Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Sin, and we muſt look upon our
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:110487:43"/>ſelves as Sinners reduced to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of unworthineſs and annihilation. <hi>Vide Domine, &amp; conſidera, quoniam ſum vilis;</hi> As deſerving that all Creatures riſe up againſt us, as being unworthy of all the Conſolations and Comforts, of all the Aſſiſtance which we receive of him, and laſtly as having no right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of any bad uſage, becauſe there is none which we do not deſerve. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ut if we compare afterward thoſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which our Condition requires of us with thoſe we really have, with this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent inclination for greatneſs, will this niceneſs and ſenſibility even in ſmall and trivial things, with this Tiranical propenſity, to be obnoxious to all men, and to relate all to our ſelves, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that we ſhould not be amazed at ſo ſtrange a Depoſition, and ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Reaſon and Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Although theſe Conſiderations may be uſeful to all the World, they are nevertheleſs proper particularly to thoſe who return to God after great Strayings. But there is another ſtudy of ones ſelf much more tedious and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and which makes the exerciſe of the Juſt even during their whole life. It conſiſts in knowing thoſe Paſſions,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:110487:43"/>Humors, weakneſſes, defects, deceits, which ſelf-love makes uſe of to hide them both from our ſelves, and others, and the ſecret Injuſtices wherein this Self-love engages us. 'Tis to what each one is obliged to apply himſelf unto with Care, as to the chief means to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance himſelf therein. for all the faults of the Juſt, as well the ſmall ones as the important ones, do happen ordinarily, only becauſe they do not know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves enough, that they do not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves juſtice enough, and that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, and keep cloſe a great part of their faults from themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. The perſwaſion wherein one ought to be as to the importance of this Duty, and the application to practiſe it, which ought to ſpring from it, will make one preſently diſcover a great number of faults. For it is certain, that that which ordinarily cauſes that the moſt part of our faults are unknown to us, is becauſe as ſoon as we perceive any of them, we look another way, taking them for objects which incommode us, and ſo they make little or no impreſſion upon our Minds. Likewiſe we look upon them only ſeparately, as if we had only the fault which we are forced to ſee at
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:110487:44"/>that very moment. All thoſe we have obſerved in paſſing by, remain as it were annihilated in regard of us. The incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and cuſtoms which remain, we reckon as nothing, and ſtopping alſo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at ſimple actions, and yet as ſlightly as poſſibly we can, we never have time to form an Idea of our ſelves, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humble.</p>
                  <p>We can make no progreſs in the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our ſelves, but in correcting this fault, and taking a quite contrary way, which is to force the Mind to conſider its faults and imperfections, with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious application to annex one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according as they are diſcovered to endeavour to ſearch to the bottom of it, to examin the cauſe of the paſſions, not to think they can be eaſily deſtroyed, being ſometime without action, and to make uſe of this Image to humble our ſelves before God and Man.</p>
                  <p>In a word, we muſt act in this Study almoſt, as if we had undertaken to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour all our life time to draw our Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractures, that is to ſay, we muſt add every day ſome ſtrokes with the Pencil, but not put out what is already drawn therein; ſo we ſhall obſerve ſometimes one paſſion, ſometimes another. To
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:110487:44"/>day we ſhall diſcover one deluſion of Self-love, tomorrow another. And by that means we ſhall form by little and little a Portraiture ſo like, that we ſhall ſee every moment even what we are, ſo that we ſhall have reaſon to ſay continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to our ſelves, behold what I am. See here what I have loved ſo much, and could wiſh that the whole World might be the object of its eſteem and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. We muſt not forget, amongſt the multitude of our faults, thoſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only outward and involuntary, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us not properly guilty before God. For thoſe are they, which oftentimes humble us the moſt in our own thoughts, becauſe we are ſo vain, that we ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily judge of our ſelves, rather according to the report of men than truth. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, theſe Faults rendring us uncapable of certain actions and employments, ought to have place in the deliberations, which we make of entring or not entring into diverſe engagements which might be propoſed to us.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as they make commonly many Impreſſions upon the minds of others, we are obliged to be very circumſpect therein, becauſe we ought partly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:110487:45"/>our behaviour concerning this Impreſſion, which opens to us, or ſhuts the entrance to their Hearts, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them to ſtumble, or not to ſtumble at our Actions.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Faults and Vertues ought equally to be the object of this Examen; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we muſt endeavour to know the extent, and the greatneſs of theſe Faults; and the limits and imperfections of theſe Vertues. The one and the other is neceſſary to form a true Idea of our ſelves, and we are equally deceived in the one and in the other, by the inclination Self-love gives us to hide, or leſſen what we have that's naught, and to expoſe to view, or to encreaſe what we have that's good.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. We ought not to judge ſimply of the greatneſs, and the extent of theſe faults in relation to the conſequences, and the effects they have had, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the conſequences and the effects they may have, if God hinder them not; becauſe there is no paſſion but may be the cauſe of our utter ruin. Inconſtancy, a little motion of choler, a word of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, an inordinate deſire, a want of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection may oftentimes be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with conſequences which may change
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:110487:45"/>the whole ſtate of our life. We ſhall know it clearly in the next world, and God will let us ſee there, that he hath made us eſcape a world of dangers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, the weight of our Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence would have drawn us headlong, if he had not ſtopped the courſe of it. And we may likewiſe know ſome part thereof in this life, if we reflect upon what might happen to us from all the faults which we have committed, and on the exceſſes whereunto our paſſions might have carried us, if they had been violently excited by the objects, and favoured by occaſions, and not hindred by the obſtacles, which God placed there to keep them within certain boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, which make us acknowledge, that 'tis not through our moderation and wiſdom, that we have eſcap'd theſe great inconveniences, but meerly by Gods mercy.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. We muſt take away in the Examen of Vertues which we believe we have, what there is purely natural, and wherein Grace hath no ſhare at all. For God, who ought to be the rule of all our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, makes no account of what comes from Nature. The effects of cuſtome and habit, which is nothing but another
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110487:46"/>Nature muſt be taken away. There muſt be an abſolute depriving our ſelves from the deſire we have to pleaſe Men; and from other ſecret conſiderations from intereſts and paſſions, becauſe all that is very bad. We muſt ſeparate from it what we have deſtroyed by our ingratitude, and our ſins, becauſe, that not ſubſiſting in the eyes of God, ought not to ſubſiſt in ours. We muſt conſider how many of theſe Vertues, ſuch as they are, have little extent, force and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity: with how ſmall zeal we carry our ſelves therein, and after all theſe ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, we muſt ask our ſelves what we have yet remaining.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Not only good Qualities, and Virtues are nothing in the ſight of God; being deſtroyed by Crimes, but without having committed any, they become often uſeleſs, and even render us culpable by the little uſe we make of them. Becauſe the gifts of God include always ſome new obligation. He expects more from thoſe, to whom he hath given moſt. We owe him for the intereſt of his Favours and Graces; and if we fail to give it him, he would rather we had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them. If he hath given us a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable natural Condition; if he hath
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:110487:46"/>preſerved us from temptations which carry away moſt part of others; if we have had little to conteſt within our ſelves; if he hath given us ſome good qualities of mind, ſome propenſity, and inclination to vertue; Laſtly if he hath beſtowed on us vertue it ſelf, we ought to look upon all that as Talents from God, yet only conditionall to encreaſe them, ſo that if we know we have not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, there is nothing ought to give us more confuſion and fear.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. We ought above all to conſider the ill uſe we have made of all the Truths God hath been pleaſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us, be it in the elevating us thereby inwardly or outwardly, be it in prophaning them by indiſcreet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, or that we make uſe of them not to contemn or deſpiſe our ſelves, but others. For that is the uſe, or rather the moſt common abuſe, that men make thereof. 'Tis impoſſible that thoſe who know the Truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſhould not ſee at the ſame time, how little they are obſerved by a great many, who at other times make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Piety. We may ſee that they want light in many points, and that they commit divers conſiderable faults.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:110487:47"/>And malice placing it ſelf on that ſide, takes delight in buſying it ſelf about theſe defects. It exaggerates them, it ſtuffs it ſelf with them, and thereby diſſwades the Mind from whatever might be able to edifie it in thoſe, in whom we obſerve them. Every thing wounds and ſhocks theſe ſo clear-ſighted, but little charitable Men; If a Monaſtery do not follow the rules preſcribed by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church, they do no more good in it, they buſie themſelves only in that, and make no accompt of what it hath otherwiſe of God. They have reaſon in what they condemn, but they have not to condemn it with ſo little meekneſs, humility and charity: ſo that they blame things oftentimes after a manner more blamable than the evil it ſelf, by which they are hurt.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. We may ſay that 'tis nothing but the want of will, which is able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that we arrive not at this degree of Self-knowledge, being we imagin that Men do not apply themſelves to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen, except in viſible faults. What remains is more difficult, becauſe it is active in giving means to diſcover thoſe which we cannot find in our ſelves, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of judgment, or elſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:110487:47"/>through the devices of Self-love. We hardly ſee any one, in whom we do not think to find ſome faults which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him; and as we ought to judge thereby, that this Illuſion is very common, the leſt we can conclude of it is, that it is much to be feared, we are not more exempt from it than others.</p>
                  <p>We have likewiſe no reaſon to aſſure our ſelves, that theſe ſecret and hidden faults are not very conſiderable, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver capable to hinder Salvation. This is by no means true; the blindneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are, is able to hide very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ones from us. How many for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, do we ſee, who not knowing their want of Underſtanding, do undertake Employments, and therein commit very great faults. Men chuſe their Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Employments ill, they ſlight thoſe which are proper for them, and apply themſelves to others in which they cannot proſper. Men ingage themſelves in conteſts which have evil conſequences, they think they are in the right when they are in the wrong, and upon this ſcore they deal hardly with others; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite murmurings, againſt themſelves; they deſtroy the whole Edification, they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:110487:48"/>were able to give by their other actions. There are ſome, who for want of knowing what they have that's trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in their humors and conducts, raiſe a coldneſs, and a diſguſt in the hearts of others, who diſunite by this means whole Societies, who divert Perſons from their way, and ſtifle in them the ſeeds which God has ſown therein. There are ſome who ſerve as obſtacles (not dreaming of it) to many uſefull and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things, becauſe they do not know how to behave themſelves in treating with them.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome, who by ſmall tyes, or wilfull preventions which they know not of, are hindred from ſatisfying theſe important Duties, the omitting of which becomes a ſcandal to thoſe who ſee them act; and cauſeth great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Laſtly, it ſeldom happens, that theſe viſible errors have not their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from thoſe faults which men will not ſee.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. This ought to ſuffice to make us joyn to the Examen, which we ought to make of our ſelves, what ſtrength we can draw from others to know our ſelves better. There are ſeveral ways that it may be procured, but I ſhall only take
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:110487:48"/>notice of the two principal ones which comprehend many others. The one is in ſome ſort to go before Truth it ſelf, ſeeking it in the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>mple and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of other People; the other to ſuffer that it approach us, in giving it a free acceſs, and taking away all obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which may hinder this approach.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. We ſeek truth in other Mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, by the reflections we make on their Actions, which extend to their Vertues, and to their faults: Their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues inſtruct us in thoſe we want, they convince us of our weakneſs and of our baſeneſs, and they humble us by this compariſon. It is enough alſo, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that there be ſome difference of light and conduct betwixt others and us, to give us thereby means to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves. Becauſe altho Self-love perſwades us at firſt; that we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on our ſide; yet if we obſerve that other Mens conduct hath ordinarily good ſucceſs, and that ours on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hath always bad, we ſhould be wilfull to believe that we are not in the wrong.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. 'Tis almoſt the only means to acknowledge in ones ſelf what Men call falſe judgment, which is a defect that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:110487:49"/>makes Men undertake croſs buſineſſes, engages them in falſe parties, in various opinions, and in evil arguments. For altho this ſame lack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> judgment, which produceth theſe falſe Opinions, may be a hinderance to the direct acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, yet if it happen, that a man had the fortune to obſerve, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally he was ſingle in his ſentiment, and that his thought were almoſt alway con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to every Bodies elſe, he muſt be extreamly opinionated, to conclude from thence that he is in the right. And thus the leaſt he can do is to be miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his Judgment, and of the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Underſtanding, and to conſult ſincerely upon the Points, in which he ſhall have ſome particular advices, the moſt able, and moſt diſintereſted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he knows, by endeavouring in good earneſt to embrace their Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. It is by ſo much more important to endeavour to be edified by other mens Vertues, and good qualities, by how much more we ought to acknowledge in us an inclination which ſeparates us from them. Our wickedneſs hides part of them from us, and makes us apply our ſelves to thoſe which it cannot hide from us; we abſolutely either forget
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:110487:49"/>them, or we ſcarcely take notice of thoſe who have them, in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; on the contrary, their faults make very deep impreſſions in our minds. We conſerve of them very live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly images, which preſent themſelves on their own accord without the trouble of ſeeking them, and we renew continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe images and impreſſions by new Reflections, to hinder them from loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any thing of their force and ſtrength. However we ought to do the contrary, ſeeing that whereas there are very few, who are charged to remedy other Mens faults, there is none on the contrary, God does not oblige to profit by their Vertues. For he propoſes them to all thoſe who ſee them as a living and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated inſtruction, for which he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an accompt one day, as of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther favours he hath done them.</p>
                  <p>But it is not forbid to obſerve in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers certain viſible faults, and it is likewiſe impoſſible not to ſee what ſtrikes upon our ſenſes, we muſt try to make uſe of them, thereby to know our ſelves better, and to the end we may draw this advantage from thence, we muſt firſt perceive ſome of thoſe faults, we muſt ask our ſelves; <hi>Num quid ego
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:110487:50"/>unquam Imprudens facio ſimile huic?</hi> Did not I fall my ſelf into theſe Faults, which I obſerve in this Man? The occaſion of making theſe kind of reflections, are but too common; becauſe Self-love, which has a thouſand tricks to conceal from us our proper faults, hath no leſs to diſcover thoſe of others. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as its delicateneſs does ſcarcely permit us to look ſtedfaſtly upon our own, it renders us on the contrary clear-ſighted in reſpect of thoſe of others. We ſee them ſuch as they are; we conſider them as much as we will, we hardly trouble our ſelves to leſſen them by favourable excuſes; this effect comes doubtleſs from ſome bad cauſes. But keeping them within their boundaries ſome profit may be drawn from thence, and uſe made thereof to deceive in ſome ſort Self-love. For by conſidering thus the faults of others without this multiplicity of conſiderations, and artificial excuſes, which deceive us in ours, we may eaſily diſcover what is the falſe light which dazles them, how they have engaged themſelves in this Illuſion, what they ought to do to be delivered from it. And afterwards, in turning all theſe Conſiderations towards our ſelves, we
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:110487:50"/>may eaſily apply them to our ſelves, if we have never ſo little ſincerity, and deſire to know our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Unleſs we make uſe of this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to profit by the fault of another, which we cannot hinder our ſelves from ſeeing, they only blind us more inſtead of helping us to know our ſelves. For either we take occaſion to ſlight thoſe who fall therein by raiſing our ſelves above them, as if we were exempt, or if we acknowledge our ſelves guilty as well as they, we comfort our ſelves, that we alone are not ſubject to theſe Weakneſſes. We are glad that they have not this advantage over us. We diminiſh the Idea we have of our own faults, as looking upon them common to many, and as being rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences and infirmities of Nature than of our diſorder. And thus we free our ſelves in ſome ſort ſecretly from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of our Conſciences, by hiding our ſelves in the throng of the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. But beſides the Inſtructions which may be drawn out of other mens faults which we perceive by our ſelves, very important ones may likewiſe be drawn from the Iudgments which we hear
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:110487:51"/>made of them by thoſe who entertain themſelves with them. For we may learn that 'tis in vain to diſſemble our own, and be angry at thoſe who ſpeak of them; we thereby only apply people more to do it. Becauſe whereas they are ordinarily very indulging to the Imperfections of thoſe who ſeriouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them, they do not ſuffer on the contrary patiently thoſe which we would hide or canonize, and of which they do not permit us to ſpeak with freedom. Although they be ſomething reſerved in ſpeaking with thoſe, of whom they have ſome reaſon to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful, they may find always ſome one to whom they may ſpeak freely; ſo by this means things are diſperſed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from one to another, almoſt as if they did ſpeak them publickly. So that we muſt ſhew that the only way to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men from ſpeaking of our faults is to Correct them our felves, or to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that we deſire it ſeriouſly, and that we are well pleaſed to be put in mind of them.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. We may learn by theſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that hardly any one knows what is thought of him, nor what Impreſſion his Actions make upon the minds of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:110487:51"/>others; from whence it happens, that in forming to our ſelves falſe opinions of their diſpoſition, we take in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion falſe meaſures. We do not the Good we ought, nor prevent the Evil which we might; we diſturb others a thouſand ſeveral ways without knowing it, and we break thus by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle all the tyes which knit the union we have with them.</p>
                  <p>We perceive it well at the end of ſome of theſe bad effects, but that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſeth the illuſion we are in. For the lack of knowing the cauſes which are given them, we ſubſtitute falſe ones. We caſt all the Blame on others, we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to them the Motives, Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Deſigns on which they never thought, and upon that we form of them very diſadvantageous <hi>Ideas,</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing without by ſome exterior marks do yet encreaſe the remoteneſs they have from us.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. 'Tis true we muſt not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule our Conduct by the opinions and Impreſſions of others. But theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Impreſſions being uniform they give us often means to acknowledge, That this Conduct is not regulated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods Laws; others being
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:110487:52"/>ordinarily more ſubtil then we to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what happens in us of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Self-love. Even often times when theſe Impreſſions are unjuſt, they do not forbear to have ſome cauſe in us, the which we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>medy. In fine how unreaſonable they are, as they may be either ſharpen'd or ſweeten'd by our Conduct, they may ſerve for obſtacles to certain enterpriſes, and facilitate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and we may ſometimes take other courſes to avoid them. It's always good to know them, provided we are able to undergo them.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. We might obtain this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and we might ſhun one part of the inconveniences if we did practice ſincerely what is obſerved in St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Life, which was that one of his Friends ſhould advertiſe him of all that he found fit to tell him again in his Carriage. And it is what they had in Proſpect who have ordered that in certain Religious Houſes, That there ſhould be one Perſon Charged to receive the complaints that each ſhould make of the Superiors Behavior, to give him an account thereof, without naming the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. But as all the World cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy this Good we ought to endeavour
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:110487:52"/>to ſupply it by procuring a faithful and underſtanding Friend to whom an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire liberty ſhould be given to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe us of what ſhould be ſaid of us in the World, and after what manner our actions might be taken therein.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. It ſeems at firſt that the moſt part of the World do follow theſe advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that at leaſt it is practiced by all perſons who profeſs Piety. For there are none who have not a Confeſſor, and this Confeſſor ought to be that faithful friend who ſhould advertiſe us of our faults, of the ſcandal which we cauſe, ſeeing that we give him that right in addreſſing our ſelves to him. He may know them ſo much better, as he joyns to the knowledge we give him of our ſelves, that which he ſometimes may get elſewhere, and that thus he ſees the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of our light, that is to ſay, what we know of our ſelves, and what we know not. And as the practice of this Office of Charity makes one of the chief parts of his Miniſtry. There is hardly any one who does not flatter himſelf, That 'tis that he ſeeks in ſubmitting himſelf to the Conduct of a Director, and who does not believe that he gives him in this point all the liberty which he can deſire.</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:110487:53"/>
                  <p n="38">38. Whoſoever will unfold theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret windings of his own heart, will find that although he think not to addreſs himſelf to a Confeſſor except to draw from thence ſome help the better to know himſelf, he hath at the bottom of his heart a quite contrary end, and a ſecret deſign to make uſe thereof to Juſtifie himſelf in his faults, which is properly not knowing himſelf. This it is we do not take heed of to confeſs in our ſelves, ſeeing that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we know it not, and that we have alſo on the outward appearance of the mind a quite different thought. But Self-love which reſides in the bottom of the Soul knows how to proſper there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our making any expreſs reflections. See here the Artifice ſelf-love makes uſe of. We have two ſorts of faults, the firſt which are the object of our Affection, and which we will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge for faults for fear of being obliged to diſanul them; the others that we really condemn are thoſe which we have no inclination to, and from which we would very willingly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. Self-love makes us therefore firſt chooſe a Ghoſtly Father, who ought to Judge of us almoſt as we would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:110487:53"/>Afterwards it makes as it were a kind of Covenant and Bargain with him. Self-love tells him the faults it loves not: it is content that he find fault with them, as it would it ſelf. But the Object of its principal Paſſions it ſcarcely puts under the Cenſure of the Confeſſor, and only chooſes him, thinking that he will not concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore firſt we juſtifie our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to our ſelves, and at laſt we ſeek a Ghoſtly Father to juſtifie them. In a word we would have one who might not outgo us in direction, and who would conform in every thing, that is, we would he ſhould approve and condemn what we our ſelves approve and condemn.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. 'Tis that which is the cauſe that there being even amongſt thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Piety ſo many ſtrange and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Conducts, there is hardly any one nevertheleſs who wants a Director, if he will have one; and this Director is of no uſe to thoſe that would chooſe him in this manner, but to ſtifle their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſes, and to make them live more quietly in the condition, out of which they have no deſire to depart.</p>
                  <p>Thus we may define a Director in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:110487:54"/>of the moſt part of the World, a charitable Cenſurer of ſmall faults, and light defects, and an Approver of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which we will not remove. We would not have a Director who would not find fault at all, and we would not have one neither who touches upon our beloved paſſions. Theſe two Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are both equally eſſential; becauſe, as it would be troubleſome, if he did pretend to contradict us in what we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve abſolutely to do, he would ſerve our Self-love but ill, if he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict us in ſome thing, our intention being to make uſe of his zeal againſt certain faults, to authoriſe us in thoſe we would not acknowledge for ſuch.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. Therefore tis not ſufficient to have a Director, nor even to have one learned. We muſt moreover abandon our ſelves to him without diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and artifice, and reſolve to conform our ſelves to the judgment he makes of us, and not to incline him to follow ours. Laſtly, we muſt be ready to learn from him to know our ſelves better, and be glad of his aid and aſſiſtance therein, without preſcribing him limits. 'Tis the diſpoſition all the World ought to be in; but 'tis not neceſſary that it be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:110487:54"/>perfect, or rather it is impoſſible that it ſhould be ſo. Becauſe there is no man upon Earth, who hath humility enough, and force to ſupport, without being diſcouraged and afraid of the ſight of the leaſt ſin in its natural greatneſs; and it is true to ſay of all our known ſins in their greateſt extent, what the Scripture ſaid of God. <hi>Non videbit me homo, &amp; vivet.</hi> Thus to take a proportionable Conduct, both of the neceſſity we all have of Truth, and to the weakneſs which renders us incapable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going it in all its force, we muſt wiſh ardently to know it. We muſt embrace with docility what is diſcovered of it to us; we muſt believe that we are mightily ſpared, and labour neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to become more ſtrong, to the end we may be leſs obliged to ſpare our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. We would doubtleſs advance hugely in this ſelf-knowledge, if we really had this diſpoſition in the heart, by treating with the Confeſſor we have choſen. But we muſt however not grant only to this Confeſſor the right of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to us our faults, and the evil conſequences of our actions. On the contrary, It would be juſt to ſtretch
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:110487:55"/>this right as far as we can poſſible; and to give it alſo in ſome ſort to all the World, ſeeing there is not any to whom we are not anſwerable, and whom we are not able to hurt and ſcandalize. How circumſpect ſoever a Confeſſor may be, he ſees not always our actions; he hears not all we ſay, he knows not always the impreſſions our words and our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions make upon others; and it is ſcarcely, except from thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them that they can be learnt. One ſhould therefore learn the cuſtom of being leſs delicate in this point, and give all the world an honeſt liberty. Poſſibly we ſhould receive oftentimes advertiſements leſs cenſurable. But if we will receive only thoſe which ſhall appear altogether reaſonable, we ſhall receive none at all. For men will never charge themſelves with ſo ſevere an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, and they will much ſooner looſe the Party by ſaying nothing at all to us, than expoſe themſelves to hurt us, if what they ſhould ſay did not appear to us abſolutely juſt.</p>
                  <p>We muſt on the other ſide ſuppoſe, that every one being prepoſſeſſed on the one part, that he loves not to be admoniſhed of his faults, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:110487:55"/>unwilling to ſhow any averſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, is diſpoſed by this means to free himſelf from rendring us this charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble office, and to tell us nothing what he thinks of us, nor what he knows others think of us. Thus except we remove this obſtacle, and go as it were before Truth, in exciting others to tell it us, in teſtifying to them in an unſuſpected manner, that we think our ſelves in ſome ſort obliged that they ſhould do it, and thus diſperſing the fear they have of rendring themſelves odious, they will always obſerve with us this deceitfull reſervedneſs, which entertains and keeps us in ignorance of many things which would be very neceſſary to be known.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. We muſt not imagin, that it is ſufficient to receive without being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the advices which are given us, and to thank thoſe who run the hazzard of giving us them. For it is well enough known to all the World, that, as it is a ſhame to ſhew that one is offended at them, ſo we endeavour to do our ſelves ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in being civil upon theſe occaſions. But we muſt perſuade People that theſe civilities are ſincere; and it is that which cannot be without ſhunning many things, which the World take for marks of a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:110487:56"/>ſecret diſcontent and ſpite, which we are afraid to diſcover.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. We muſt not pretend for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they ever take the liberty to adviſe us of any thing, if they ſee that we have no union and tye, but with thoſe who enter abſolutely into all our Sentiments; and that we teſtifie to all others nothing but drineſs and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>If they ſee, that after this confidence which they ſhall have ſhewn us, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a reſervedneſs of mind, that we find our ſelves entangled every time we are with them, and that we act no more after a free and natural manner. If they ſee that to have more right to reject the Advice which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, we give an evil cenſure of it, that we ſeek every where for People, who condemn them by propoſing them after an odious faſhion; if we ſeek in the perſons of thoſe, who give them wherewith to decry their Judgments; if in occaſions which preſent themſelves, we ſpeak of them with more ſharpneſs then ordinarily. Laſtly if they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that that hath made a wound in our heart, let us be mindfull of it, and let us mingle on purpoſe in our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:110487:56"/>certain affected Apologies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the things we have been adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of. If we do not avoid, ſay I, all thoſe things which ſhew us to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly grieved, we muſt not hope that they will ſtop at words of Civility, which are deſtroyed by ſo many marks of ſecret diſcontent, and thoſe real.</p>

'Tis the ſentiment of a wiſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, that he who is advertiſed of any fault, ought not to do the ſame preſently, in reſpect of him from whom he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this advertiſement, and that he ought to expect an other time to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him this office. But this advice muſt be ſtretched much farther; for we muſt not only not reprehend upon the place thoſe who reprehend us, but we muſt alſo avoid reprehending them when there is reaſon to ſuſpect, that any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſpite ſhould have open'd our eyes to ſee their faults, and made us atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to obſerve them. We ought to ſuppoſe they are in pain to know the effect of the Advices they have given, and that they will perceive the leaſt ſign which we ſhall give of diſapprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: That they will refer to this cauſe all they ſhall remark in us of coldneſs, and averſion to them, which might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:110487:57"/>theſe advices unprofitable to them, and give them leave to make a raſh judgment of us. And this is it which obliges us to ſtand upon our guards on that ſide, and to teſtifie to them even more freedom and confidence, than we would have done at another time.</p>

It is ſo much more important to preſerve this conduct towards thoſe, who run the hazard of giving us this Advice; becauſe in acting otherwiſe we do not ſhut the mouth only of one or two Perſons, but almoſt generally to all the World.

Eeach man ſeeks pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to free himſelf from the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe Curious men. We fear always to diſturb and vex them.

But if you think that we cannot uſe this conduct one towards the other, without the danger of hurting Charity, we ſhall do better to abſtain from it. For altho this ſort of Charity, which I deſired we might practice together, be very excellent; nevertheleſs, it is better to entertain our ſelves in this other to which you have reduced me, than to have none all.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:110487:59"/>with us. Thus every one is reſerved, and leaves us to believe what we have a mind, mocking often at us inwardly. But they will ſay; Is it only that we may not paſs for Opinators in the minds of thoſe, who would be believed in all they propoſe; that we ſhall be forced to grant, that we approve Opinions which in effect we do not, and yeild to all the Advices the firſt comer ſhall think good to give us? 'Tis by this means that People juſtifie in themſelves and flatter themſelves, that their ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs, and their inflexibility in their Sentiments, proceed only from the love they have for Truth. But it is eaſie to convince them, that one may avoid the reputation of being tied to ones own ſenſe, without approving all the thoughts of others, which would be a very great fault. To do this, 'tis but to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh reaſonable Certainty which is a Vertue, from Self-opinion which is a vice.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. We cannot juſtly force whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be, to yeeld to our Judgments, not being convinced, nor yet accuſe him of being obſtinate. Becauſe if it is through knowledge that he is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of it, he is praiſe-worthy for
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:110487:59"/>not yeelding to what is falſe; If it is lack of underſtanding, and of light he may accuſed of theſe faults, but not of that of being obſtinate. Alſo the world does not commit this injuſtice, when we give it elſewhere what it hath a right to exact from us. See here in what it conſiſts. Tho men in this life be not abſolutely incapable of knowing any truth certainly; yet there are ſo many things which they ſee but obſcurely, and they are ſo often deceived in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that for a certainty, which indeed is not ſo, in conſidering objects confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, and in not ſeeing therein all that is neceſſary to judge by, that the leaſt they ought to do, is to have a general diſtruſt of their ſentiments and thoughts, when they are not expreſly confirmed by Faith, and the Authority of the Church. This diſtruſt cauſes not them to be indetermined, and that they do not take ſome part, but it hinders them from propoſing their thoughts with a determinative Air, and to be troubled when they are contradicted. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt makes them give ear, and examin ſeriouſly the reaſons alledged againſt their Opinions. Laſtly, it makes them ſlight the Opinions they approve not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:110487:60"/>of, with ſo much Modeſty, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main perſwaded that they ſhould have diſpoſed to embrace them, if they had had light enough to penetrate into the Reaſons. This is the diſpoſition the World doth force from us, and with Reaſon, becauſe we ought to have it in effect. And the contrary to this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is to ſay, that aſſurance which excludes even general diſtruſt, that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative Air, that manner of rejecting other mens Opinions without taking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the pains to examin them, as if they were incapable of finding out the Truth, or of being deceived, is that properly, which men call being Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niator.</p>
                  <p>'Tis that which repulſes the World, and hinders it from ſpeaking freely to us, becauſe 'tis always imagin'd that it would be in vain, for when we have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous'd a cauſe, we never forſake it; but after having conteſted ſoundly, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways think that we have Reaſon, and that others have not. Thus every one had rather leave all in that Condition, and abandon us to our own light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out propoſing theirs to us.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. We produce almoſt the ſame bad Effects, if without conteſting and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:110487:60"/>wilfulneſs, we remain nevertheleſs in a certain coldneſs, without appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either to approve or diſapprove the liberty which our Friends take in telling us their opinions. For as they are naturally inclin'd to believe, that this liberty is not pleaſing to us, and that they are in diſtruſt upon this point; Whoſoever deſtroys not this Impreſſion by his Air, and by his way of anſwering, gives leave to beleeve, that he would willingly that it may ſubſiſt or remain, and his ſilence being taken with probability for a token of diſcontent, the World thinks it ſelf freed from making for the future the like attempts.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. If we be carefull to avoid theſe, and ſuch like faults, we may engage our true Friends to tell us ſometimes what they think of our Actions, and to let us know after what manner the World takes them. But to judge well of what they tell us we muſt obſerve this rule, that as Natural Complacency, fear of troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and civility it ſelf, obliges thoſe who ſpeak to us of our faults to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves much in their expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; If we will know their Judgment exactly, we muſt add of our ſelves what is wanting in their words, and not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:110487:61"/>imagin that theſe thoughts come into their mind with all theſe reſtrictions, and theſe mollifications which they uſe in propoſing them to us. Let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour therefore, that they tell us only ſome ſmall part of what is judged of us, and that we muſt multiply in ſome ſort all that is ſaid of us to find out the Truth. If they tell us, that they have ſome little to contradict in ſome thing we have done, that ſignifies that there is therein much to be gainſaid. If they ſay they make ſome difficulty in ſome Argument, that means that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it falſe and ridiculous. If they tell us that they cannot without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enter into any of our thoughts, that is, they diſapprove and condemn them. If they give us notice that there are ſome People who harm themſelves by certain Actions, that is to ſay, there are a great number who are ſcandalized at them. Laſtly, it muſt be ſuppoſed that the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Advertiſements is a particular Language; that we do expreſs our ſelves therein but by halves; that they are nothing but perpetual ſilences, and that unleſs we ſupply and underſtand it at half Sentences, we are deceiv'd by thoſe even who ſtrive to undeceive us.</p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:110487:61"/>
                  <p n="52">52. If man had as much ſubtilty and craft for what relates to his Happineſs as generally he hath for his Intereſts, he would not only diſcover the Truth from under ſome little Clouds, the goodneſs and Prudence whereof might ſerve to ſweeten and temper it, but he would even diſtinguiſh it in the moſt profound obſcurity of Fiction and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. We alter it by the fiction of flatteries; we diſſemble it by ſilence; But very often it relies only on us to diſtinguiſh it in the one and the other. Becauſe there is always ſomething of Truth in flattery it ſelf, and Silence hath alſo its Language; which hath cauſed St. <hi>Jerom</hi> to call the ſilence of St. <hi>Aſelle,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p n="53">53. To Comprehend what there may be of Truth in flattery we need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſtinguiſh the preciſe ſenſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from the thoughts which they give us leave to read in the mind of thoſe who make uſe of them. There is no Truth at all in the preciſe ſenſe of the expreſſions of Flatterers, ſeeing that we take here the term of Flattery for a falſe Praiſe. But they give leave to know many of their thoughts, and to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:110487:62"/>inſtruct us by theſe thoughts of many Truths which concern us.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, when they give theſe Praiſes, they believe the quite contrary what they ſay, and contemn as much in their hearts thoſe to whom they give them as they do teſtifie outwardly eſteem for them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is drawn from the nature of ſome Praiſes which they chooſe. For they take ordinarily the ſubſtance of things truly Praiſe-worthy, which they falſly attribute to thoſe they deſire to flatter. Thus thoſe to whom whom we give Praiſes ought not to conclude from thence neither, That they have theſe qualities effectively which are attributed to them, nor that there are people who believe it, but only theſe qualities are Praiſable in themſelves, and that it were to be wiſhed that they had them, that is to ſay, that they might learn by that not what they are, but what they ought to be. 'Tis a reflexion St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> made upon the Praiſe <hi>Cicero</hi> gave to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, To forget nothing but Injuries, Nihil obliviſci niſi Injurias. Dicebat hoc,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>tam magnus Laudator, aut tam magnus Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, ſed ſi Laudator talem Caeſarem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verat, ſi autem Adulator, talem eſſe debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:110487:62"/>oſtendebat principem Civitatis, qualem illum fallaciter praedicabat. What</hi> Cicero <hi>ſaid to</hi> Caeſar, ſaid this Father, <hi>was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a greas praiſe, or a great Flattery: If it was a Praiſe he ought to believe that</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar <hi>was really ſuch an one: If it was a flattery he ſhewed always thereby, that he who Commands an Eſtate ought to have theſe qualities which he attributed falſly to</hi> Caeſar.</p>
                  <p>The third thing that Flattery teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us is of the ſame kind as the firſt. 'Tis, that the Flatterer believes not only what he ſays, but he imagins more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that he whom he flatters is Fool enough to let himſelf be deceived by his flatteries, and to take them for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Praiſes. And as we cannot approve falſe Praiſes but by flattering our ſelves, every Flatterer condemns, in himſelf, of illuſion and vanity, that man to whom he addreſſes his flatteries. This is the Judgment of it. Laſtly, as it is by Intereſt and not by inclination that we are inclined to flattery, and that we make uſe thereof only as a means to obtain of the great ones what we pretend, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers muſt judge, That thoſe to whom they give theſe falſe Praiſes are mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love with themſelves to be gained
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:110487:63"/>by ſuch groſs deceits. So that if all that is in the mind of a Flatterer were laid open and explicated, it might he reduced to this ſtrange Complement. Sir, <hi>I belive nothing of theſe Praiſes I give you, I have for you all the juſt diſdain you deſerve; but knowing that you are vain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to believe that men have in their heart the Sentiments of Eſteem which I ſhew you, and that the exceſs of love you have for your ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will be able to diſpoſe you to do me the favours. I deſire, I thought that to obtain them, I ought to attempt a way which ought to bring the contrary.</hi> Behold what the Great may ſee in the minds of moſt people who Praiſe them, if they can add to the expreſſion of theſe Flatterers what they are able to gather from their thoughts. But as that would incommode them, they had rather penetrate leſs, and ſtick at the appearances of words. And 'tis by the knowledge men have of this diſpoſition that they run the hazard to uſe this wicked means.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. The language of ſilence, is what ſilence it ſelf makes known in the minds of thoſe who are ſilent for certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. For Example, when we avoid ſpeaking of a certain fault before Great men, that ſignifies we believe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:110487:63"/>them ſubject to it, and that we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, leſt they ſhould take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what might be ſaid of it. In like manner, when in their preſence we omit to praiſe certain Perſons, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, that we imagin they love them not, and that they have a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt them. Thus they need but to obſerve the Diſcourſes that are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born before them, to know what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and what faults are laid to their charge. And as nothing is ſpoken of ſo much in mens abſence, as things which we dare not ſpeak in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, they may alſo judge by theſe Diſcourſes which we never make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, what are thoſe which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſcourſed of when we are far remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from them.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. The practice of theſe means is not only uſefull to make us know many defects which we are ignorant of, but it is very proper to obtain of God the aſſiſtance of his Lights in this ſtudy of our ſelves to which we apply our ſelves. Nevertheleſs what progreſs we may make therein, we muſt not pretend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to arrive at that pitch of knowing our ſelves perfectly. Man hath always in his heart ſo long as he is in this life;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:110487:64"/>ſome abuſes impenetrable to all theſe diligent ſearches. And it is likewiſe one part of the Knowledge we may have of our ſelves, to comprehend that we do not know our ſelves with aſſurance, in what even appears moſt Eſſential, and moſt important. For we never know certainly what is called the bottom of the Heart, or that firſt propenſity of the Soul, which makes her either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God or the Creature. I would ſay, that we know not certainly that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God, altho we may know aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly that we are not ſo.</p>
                  <p>We know not with an entire aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance the Habitation of God in the Soul, as in his Temple, becauſe 'tis an attendant of the firſt Propenſity of the Heart.</p>
                  <p>We know not abſolutely in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular actions, whether the Love of God is the Principle of them, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature and Cuſtom did not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Form of the Love of God.</p>
                  <p>None knows abſolutely if his ſins be forgiven, he knows not the preciſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his weakneſs or force, he knows not what God imputes, or not imputes to us of the continual productions of our Concupiſcences.</p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:110487:64"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, We know not evidently ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the nearneſs or the remoteneſs of God. For often we think we have Grace, when the Mind is taken up only with thoughts, and quite natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and often even we take for motives of Nature the Operations of Grace.</p>
                  <p>We ought therefore ſuppoſe, that with all our Study, and all our diligent Scrutinies, we ſhall always remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to our ſelves in this Life. But as this neceſſary Ignorance is in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of God, we bear it humbly, and believe likewiſe that it is neceſſary for us to continue therein. There is nothing but voluntary Ignorance that we ought to ſhun, becauſe it is contrary to this Order.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. In a word, we ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know our ſelves more than God pleaſeth. And God will not that we know our ſelves more than is neceſſary to make us humble, and to govern our ſelves. Thus every Application to dive to the bottom of the Heart, which is not incloſed within its limits, is not agreeable to God, nor uſefull to us.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not therefore buſie our ſelves in ſuch a manner about our faults,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:110487:65"/>leſt that under pretence of avoiding Preſumption, we fall into deſpair and trouble. Therefore whatever may be ſaid of this Portraiture, which we muſt attempt to make of our ſelves, if it happen nevertheleſs that we were ſo frighted at theſe Objects, that the Soul might thereby be overwhelmed, it would be better a great deal to turn it another way, and to buſie it only about Gods Mercies.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. Care yet ought to be had in the whole Examination of our actions and interior motions, to do our ſelves the ſame juſtice that we think we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do to others, that is to ſay, not to condemn our ſelves without E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that we are ignorant whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our better Actions are good and agreeable to God, but yet we know much leſs whether they are diſagreeable.</p>
                  <p>There are intermixt therewith many human and corrputed Conſiderations, but we cannot tell whether they be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and what part thereof we have, whether they are not pure motives of Concupiſcence, which God doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to us, or temptations of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which render us yet leſs guilty.</p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:110487:65"/>
                  <p>We acknowledge in us a great ſtock of Corruption, but this ſtock whatever it be, doth not render us guilty when there is another ſtock of the Love of God and Juſtice, which poſſeſſeth our hearts.</p>
                  <p>We have committed, and we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit hourly an Infinity of faults, but God pardons alſo hourly this infinity of faults, when we return to him with a true and ſincere humility. And thus we cannot tell whether theſe faults do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt before his eyes.</p>
                  <p>What therefore muſt be done in this Ignorance? We muſt humble our ſelves under the Hand of God, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our ſelves; becauſe that would be to attribute to our ſelves a Knowledge which we have not.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. Laſtly, The principal Precaution that ought to be had in the ſtudy of ones Self, is, not to apply ones ſelf ſo abſolutely to it, but joyn it always with the infinite Mercies of God, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs ſo much all our miſeries, that they are only as a drop of water in the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. 'Tis therefore in this immenſe Sea that we muſt drown them, with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire confidence. Conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are great, but compared to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:110487:66"/>the infinite Greatneſs of Gods Love for us, and the price he hath given to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us, they are nothing. They ought to humble us without caſting us down, as the Mercy of God to comfort us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out elevating us. God was willing to give us theſe two great objects of our miſery and his Mercy to keep our Soul in <hi>Aequilibrio,</hi> or even ballance. There is always danger in conſidering the one without the other, but the uinon of theſe two Conſiderations eſtabliſh the Soul in the true ſtate, wherein ſhe ought to be during this Life, which is that of the wholſom fear grounded upon the conſideration of our miſeries, and an humble confidence maintained by Gods Mercy.</p>

               <head>The Second Treatiſe.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Charity and Self-love.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ltho there is nothing ſo oppoſite to Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which relates all to God, as Self-love which relates all to it ſelf, yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo reſembling the effects of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as thoſe of Self-love. For it mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſo by the ſame ways, that one can hardly point out thoſe better whereunto Charity ought to carry us, than in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing thoſe which Self-love takes, which knows its true Intereſts, and inclines by reaſon to the end it propoſes it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This conformity of Effects in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſo different, will not appear ſtrange to thoſe who ſhall have well
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:110487:67"/>conſidered the nature of Self-love. But to know it he muſt firſt conſider Self-love in it ſelf, and in its firſt bent, that he may ſee afterwards what carrieth him to diſguiſe and hide it from the ſight of the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The name of Self-love is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make us know its nature, being we may love our ſelves divers ways. We muſt add thereunto other qualities to form to our ſelves a true Idea of it. Theſe qualities are, that Man doth not only love himſelf, but he loves himſelf without limits, and without meaſure; loves only himſelf, and refers all to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He covets all ſort of Riches, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, Pleaſures, and deſires none but for, or in relation to himſelf. He makes himſelf the Center of all; he would Lord it over all, and could wiſh that all Creatures were only employed to content him, to praiſe him, and to admire him. This tyrannical diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being ſtamped in the bottom of all mens Hearts, renders them violent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, cruel, ambitious, flatterers, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, inſolent and quarrellous. In a word, it includes the ſeeds of all the crimes, and of all the miſdemeanors of men, from the ſmalleſt, even to the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:110487:67"/>ones. See here what a monſter we harbour in our boſoms. This mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter lives, and reigns in us abſolutely, except God deſtroy its empire by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting another love into our hearts. It is the Principal of all our actions, which have no other then corrupted Nature: And ſo far is it from terrifying us that we love, and hate all things which are out of us, only as they are conform or contrary to our Inclinations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if we love it in our ſelves, we are far from uſing it ſo when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in others. It appears then to us, on the contrary under its natural form, and we hate it by ſo much more as we love our ſelves, becauſe Self-love of other men oppoſes all the deſires of ours. We would that all others ſhould love us, admire us, buckle under us, and that they ſhould be buſied with the care of ſatisfying us. And they have not only no deſire thereto, but they look upon us as ridiculous in pretending to it, and they are ready to do all, not only to hinder us from ſucceeding in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but to make us obnoxious to theirs, and to require the ſame things of us. Behold then by this means all men at difference one with another; And if he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:110487:68"/>who hath ſaid, that Men are born in a ſtate and condition of War, and that each man is naturally an enemy to all other men, had a mind only to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by theſe words the diſpoſition of the Hearts of men, one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without pretence of paſſing it for legitimate and juſt; he would have ſaid a thing as conform to Truth and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as that which is maintained is contrary to Reaſon and Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It cannot poſſibly be imagined how there can be formed Societies, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and Kingdoms out of this multitude of People full of paſſions, ſo contrary to Union, and who only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the ruin of one another. But Self-love which is the cauſe of this war, will eaſily tell the way how to make them live in peace. It loves Domination, it loves to enſlave all the World to it, but it loves yet more life and convenientneſs, and an eaſie life more than Dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſees clearly that others are no ways diſpoſed to ſuffer themſelves to be domineered over, and are ſooner ready to take away from it the Goods it loves beſt. Each man ſees himſelf in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of ſucceeding by force in the deſigns which his Ambition ſuggeſts to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:110487:68"/>him, and apprehends likewiſe the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by that violence of others the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Goods he poſſeſſeth. 'Tis that which obliges at firſt to ſubmit ones ſelf to the care of his own Preſervation, and there is no other way found for that, but to unite ones ſelf with others, to beat back by force thoſe who undertake to deprive us both of our lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. And to ſtrengthen this Union, laws are made, and puniſhments orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for thoſe who violate them. Thus by the means of tortures, and gibbets ſet up in publick, the thoughts and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical deſigns of every particular mans Self-love are withheld.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Fear of death is then the firſt tye of Civil ſociety, and the firſt check of Self-love. 'Tis that which forceth Men, what averſion ſoever they may have to obey the Laws, and which makes them in ſuch a manner forget theſe vaſt thoughts of Domination, that they hardly are raiſed any more in the thoughts of the moſt part of them, ſo impoſſible they ſee it is for them to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per therein.</p>
               <p>Thus ſeeing themſelves excluded from the open violence, they are conſtrained to ſeek other ways, and to ſubſtitute
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:110487:69"/>craft for force, and they find therein no other means than to endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Self-love of thoſe whom they have need of, inſtead of tyrannizing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
               <p>Some endeavour to make it fit for their Intereſts, others employ flattery to gain it. Gifts are beſtowed to obtain it. This is the ſource and foundation of all Commerce practiſed amongſt men, and which is varied a thouſand ways. For they do not truck merchandiſes for merchandiſes or for mony, but they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually traffick, I mean they make a trade alſo of labours and toyls, of ſervices done, of diligence and aſſiduity, of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; and Men exchange all that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for things of the ſame nature, or for real goods, as when by vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencies we obtain Effective com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
               <p>'Tis thus that by the means and help of this Commerce, all neceſſaries for this life are in ſome fort ſupplied without intermixing Charity with it. So that in Eſtates, where Charity hath no admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe true Religion is baniſhed from thence, men do not ceaſe to live with as much peace, ſafety and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as if they were in a Republick of Saints.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:110487:69"/>
               <p n="7">7. 'Tis not that this tyrannical Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which makes us have a deſire to rule and govern by force over others, is not always lively in the hearts of Men. But as they ſee themſelves unable to proſper therein, they are forced to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it, untill they are ſtrengthened by gaining others by ſweet ways, to have afterwards the means to bring others to their bent by force. Every one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fote is mindfull at firſt to occupy the firſt. Rank of the Society he is of, and when he ſees himſelf excluded, he thinks of thoſe which follow. In a word, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolls himſelf the moſt he can, and he humbles himſelf only by conſtraint. In every ſtate, and in every condition he endeavors always to acquire to himſelf ſome Preheminence, Authority, Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, Conſideration, Juriſdiction, and to dilate his power as much as he can. Princes wage war with their Neighbors, that they may enlarge the limits of their Eſtates. The Officers of ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies in one and the ſame Country, undertake and intrude upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: They ſtrive to ſupplant them, and to humble each other in all their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys, and in all their Offices. And if the wars which are made there are not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:110487:70"/>ſo bloody as thoſe which Princes make; 'Tis not becauſe the paſſions are not as quick and ſharp, but 'tis for the moſt part becauſe they dread the puniſhment, which the Laws threaten to thoſe who have recourſe to violent ways.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I ſee nothing more proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent this Spiritual world formed by Concupiſcence, then the Idea which ſome Philoſophers give us of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial World made by Nature, that is to ſay, of that Aſſembly of Bodies which compoſe the Univerſe. Becauſe we ſee there, that every part of Matter tends naturally to move and to dilate it ſelf, and to iſſue out of its place, but being preſſed by other Bodies it is confin'd too kind of priſon, from whence it eſcapes ſo ſoon as it finds that it has more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and force than the matter wherewith it is environed. Behold already the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Conſtraint, whereto the Self-love of each particular is reduced by that of others, which does not permit it to ſet it ſelf out at large ſo much as it would. We are going to ſee all the motions in the ſequel of this Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For theſe little confi'nd Bodies co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to muſter up their forces, and their motions do form great heaps of matter
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:110487:70"/>which Philoſophers call Whirlwinds, which are as States and Kingdoms: And theſe Whirlwinds are themſelves preſſed and impriſoned by other Whirlwinds, as it were by neighbouring Kingdoms. They likewiſe will, that in each Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind there are formed other ſmall ones. which following the general motions of the great Bodies which draw them, have nevertheleſs a particular motion, which doth force yet other ſmall Bodies to turn round about them; which repreſents the Grandees of State, who follow them in ſuch a manner, that they have their particular Intereſts, and are as the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a quantity of People who fix themſelves to their Fortune. Laſtly, as theſe little Bodies drawn by the Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds, do yet turn as much as they can upon their own Center, ſo likewiſe the little ones which follow the fortune of the Grandees and that of the State, do not forbear with all their endeavours and all their ſervices, which they render them, to look upon themſelves, and to have always their own proper Intereſt in proſpect.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That which ſelf-love covets par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in Soveraignty, is, that we be regarded and looked upon by others as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:110487:71"/>great and powerful, and that we ſtir up in their hearts motions of reſpect and ſubmiſſion, conform to theſe <hi>Ideas.</hi> But however it may be the Impreſſions which are moſt agreeable to it are not yet the only ones wherewith ſelf-love doth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it ſelf. It generally loves all thoſe things which are favourable to it, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, reſpect, conſtancy, and chiefly love. There are many who ſcarcely do what they ought, to make them beloved, but there are none who do not deſire to be loved, and who do not behold with great pleaſure this Propenſity in others turned towards them, which is that which is called love. What if it appear that we labour not much to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this love? 'Tis becauſe we had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give ſentiments of fear and ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under Greatneſs, or becauſe, deſiring too paſſionately to pleaſe certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we trouble our ſelves very little to pleaſe others.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Yet this does not hinder but that even when we are canryed away by more ſtrong Paſſions, we behave our ſelves after a faſhion very improper to make us be beloved, yet would be beloved, and do not perceive our ſelves incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded, when we ſee in the minds of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:110487:71"/>others motions of hatred and averſion. There are likewiſe many people, in whom this inclination of making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be beloved is ſtronger then that of Domineering and Lording over men, and who fear more mens hatred and averſion, and the judgments which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth it, then they love to be rich and powerful. Laſtly whereas there are few great ones, and few likewiſe who are able to aſpire to greatneſs, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary there are none who cannot pretend to make himſelf be beloved.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If the deſire of being loved is not then the ſtrongeſt Paſſion which ſprings from ſelf-love, at leaſt it is the moſt general. The conſiderations of Intereſt, of Ambition, of Pleaſure, ſtop many times the effects of it, but they do it not effectively. It is always active at the bottom of the Heart, and ſo ſoon as it is at liberty, it forbears not being active, and to make us deſire all that is able to procure us the love of Men, as it makes us avoid all whatſoever we think may draw upon us their hatred. It is true, we are ſometimes deceived in the diſtinction which we make of theſe things, which draw love or hatred, and that there are ſome who judge
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:110487:72"/>thereof much better, and more nicely than others. But be it that we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived therein, or that we be not, 'tis always the ſame Paſſion which acts, and which flies or ſeeks the ſame Objects. There is alſo a common diſtinction for all Men, even to a certain degree, that is to ſay, they know every one, even to ſome point, that certain actions excite hatred, and others cauſe love.</p>
               <p n="12">12. It is not needfull to dive further into the diſcription of the retreats of Self-love, to comprehend how it imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates very much Charity. It is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſay that Self-love hindring us through fear of chaſtiſement to violate the Laws, doth remove us by this means outwardly from all the Crimes, and ſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us like to thoſe who avoid them through Charity. That as Charity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts the neceſſities of others in the ſight of God, who will that we acknowledge his Favours in helping our Neighbour. Likewiſe Self-love comforts them in the ſight of their proper Intereſt. And that laſtly, there is hardly any action where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we are carried by Charity that would pleaſe God, whereunto Self-love cannot engage us to pleaſe Men.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But tho Self-love tend by theſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:110487:72"/>three motions to counterfeit Charity, we muſt for all that allow that the laſt comes nearer to it, and that it is much more extended than the two others. For there are many occaſions, where neither fear nor intereſt have any place. And we diſtinguiſh often eaſily enough what we do, either through Human fear or through abſolute Intereſt, from what we do by a motive of Charity. But it is not the ſame of Love, and eſteem for Men. This inclination is ſo nice, and ſubtile, and at the ſame time of ſuch a latitude, that there is nothing it cannot enter into; and it knows ſo well how to trim it ſelf up with the appearances of Charity, that it is almoſt impoſſible to know exquiſitly what diſtinguiſhes it from Charity. Becauſe marching in the ſame ſteps, and producing the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, it defaces with a marvellous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty all the ſigns, and characters of Self-love from whence it ſprings, becauſe it ſees very well that it could obtain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what it pretends, if they were taken notice of. The reaſon of it is, becauſe nothing doth draw upon us ſo much the thing called Averſion, as Self-love, and becauſe it cannot ſhew it ſelf without exciting it. We experience
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:110487:73"/>this our ſelves in regard of the Self-love of others. We are not able to ſuffer it ſo ſoon as we diſcover it, and it is eaſie for us to judge by that, that they are not more favourable to ours when they diſcover it.</p>
               <p>'Tis this which inclines thoſe who are ſenſible of the hatred of men, and who love not to expoſe themſelves thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to endeavour to withdraw as much as in them lies, their Self-love from the ſight of others, to diſguiſe and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit it, never to ſhew it under its natural ſhape, to imitate the behaviour of thoſe who would be intirely exempt from it, that is to ſay, perſons animated with the ſpirit of Charity, and who would not act but through Charity.</p>
               <p n="14">14. This ſuppreſſion of Self-love, is properly that which makes human Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſhews in what it conſiſteth. And 'tis this which hath cauſed a learned Man of this Age, to ſay that Chriſtian virtue deſtroys &amp; anihilates Self-love, and that human Civility hides and ſuppreſſes it.</p>
               <p>Thus this Civility which hath been the Idol of the learned Pagans, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the bottom, but a Self-love more intelligent, and exact than that of the generality of the World, which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:110487:73"/>knows how to ſhun what hurts its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and which tends to its mark, which is the eſteem and love of Men by a more ſtraight and reaſonable way, in ſhewing how Self-love doth imitate the principal actions of Charity.</p>
               <p n="15">15. 'Tis no hard matter to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in what manner Charity renders us humble. For making us love Juſtice, which is God himſelf, it makes us hate injuſtice, which is contrary to him. Now 'tis an injuſtice very viſible, that being as we are full of faults, and guilty of ſo many ſins, we would be honoured of Men, and that we ſhould pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Praiſes either by Human qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and ſo conſequently vain and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, or bygifts, which we have received of God, and which do not belong unto us. It is not juſt that a ſinner be honoured, but it is juſt that he be humbled and brought low. 'Tis the eternal Law which ordains it, &amp; Charity conſents to this law. Charity loves it, and by the love which it bears to it, embraces with joy all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and humblings. Charity makes us hate all that ſmells of pride and vanity; and as it condemns theſe motions when they ſtart up in our hearts, it hinders them alſo from appearing without by words
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:110487:74"/>and actions, which it reduces thus to an exact modeſty.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Yet there is nothing in this, but what Self-love imitates perfectly; For ſeeing the Heart of each man turned ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely towards it ſelf, and naturally an enemy to the preferring any other: It dares not expoſe it ſelf to their thought and malignity.</p>
               <p>Whoever praiſes himſelf, and ſets to ſale what he thinks he hath thats good, pretends thereby to bring others to him, and 'tis almoſt the ſame thing, as if he beg'd of them to give him praiſes, and to look upon him with eſteem and love. Now there is hardly any prayer which appears more uncivil, and more incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to Self-love, which men bear themſelves, than this. It is angry and vexed at it, and anſwers only by ſcoffing and diſdain. Thus thoſe who are cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning enough to know theſe tricks and devices, avoid making theſe kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that is to ſay, they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves generally to a diſtance from all that ſeems vanity, from all that tends to make them be taken notice of, and to ſhew theſe advantages; and they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour on the contrary to appear not to heed them, nor to know them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:110487:74"/>And that is the modeſty Civility is able to procure.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Civility doth not only flie theſe means and baſe vain glories, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Commendations which Man gives himſelf; but knowing that Self-love of others is extreamly ſubtile in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the by-ways which may be taken to make manifeſt in us what we deſire to ſhew thereby: Civility renounces theſe ſmall Crafts, and ſtudies to avoid them. It would force us rather to ſpeak of our ſelves directly and publickly, then to make uſe of theſe wicked Trucks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Civility always fears being ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therein, and knows that when men perceive them, they take a great delight to turn and make them ridiculous. Thus you ſee there is nothing more ſimple and humble then theſe Diſcourſes. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility does not Publiſh nor ſhew it ſelf by any way, and in a word, it hath for a general rule, never to ſpeak of it ſelf, or if it do, 'tis with more coldneſs and indifferency then of others.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Thoſe who have heard ſpeak of the War maintain'd by the two chief Captains of this Age, have always been raviſhed with the Civility and Modeſty of their Diſcourſe. No man hath ever
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:110487:75"/>obſerved, that the leaſt word on this Subject that could be ſuſpected of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath been ſpoken by them. They have always been ſeen to do Juſtice to all others, but never to themſelves, and one would have believed, to have heard them make a relation of ſome Battels wherein they have had the greateſt ſhare, both by their Conduct and Valour that even they were not there, or if they were, that it was without acting any thing. Let men read that News which came to <hi>Paris</hi> after the Battel of <hi>Senof,</hi> they will find therein that great Action half deminiſhed. It ſeems that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was but as Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor therein. He was every where, and it appears he was hardly in any part; and never was any thing more leſſen'd then what he contributed to the ſucceſs of this great Combate. I think that if St. <hi>Lewis</hi> ſent formerly relations of what he acted in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were deſcribed like this. So much reſemblance have Holineſs and Civility in their outward deeds and tend equally to hinder that nothing that's vain may appear therein, there being only this one difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one and the other, that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſtruck with the injuſtice of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:110487:75"/>in relation to God, and Civility is concerned for its meanneſs in relation to men.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Moreover the fear which Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity hath of exciting againſt it ſelf the natural averſion all men have for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of another may yet have in this Conduct a more cunning and delicate ſentiment of this Pride, which is born with man, and which never abandons him. Theſe people which we ſee ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied with ſome affairs wherein they have ſignalized themſelves that they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed all the World, as <hi>Cicero</hi> did by his Conſul-ſhip make appear thereby that Virtue is not at all naturall to them, and that they had need of great ſtrength to hoiſt up their Souls to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein they are ſo glad to ſhew themſelves. But there is more Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur not to make reflection upon their great Actions, ſo that they ſeem to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape us, and that they Spring ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from the Diſpoſition of the Soul that ſhe is not aware of them. This degree of Virtue is doubtleſs much more Heroick, and it is of this which human Civility, when it is at its height, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, without thinking of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, to give the <hi>Idea;</hi> or which it imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:110487:76"/>by Cunning and Policy, when it is not perfect, and proceeds rather from Reaſon then from Nature.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Who could chuſe but love that well-bred man, of whom a great Wit of this Age hath made this deſcription. <hi>Man does not paſs in the World,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for being known in Verſe, unleſs he hang but the Sign of a Poet, nor for an Able man in</hi> Mathematicks, <hi>without that of a Mathematician. But the true Well-bred men will have no Signs, and hardly put any difference betwixt the Profeſſion of a Poet and that of an Ambaſſador. They are called neither Poets nor Geomitricians, but they Judge of all thoſe. Man does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture it; they will ſpeak of things which men ſpoke of when they entred; there is not perceived in them one quality more then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, barring a neceſſity of puting it in uſe, but then they are mindful of it. Becauſe it equally belongs to this Caracter, that we ſay not of them that they ſpeak well when there is no queſtion of the Language, and that we ſay of them, That they ſpeak well when there is a queſtion of it. 'Tis therefore a falſe commendation, when one ſaith of a man when he comes in, That he is skilful in Poetry, and 'tis an ill Sign when men have recourſe to him, only becauſe he is able to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:110487:76"/>judge of ſome Verſes. Man is full of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; he loves only thoſe who are able to employ him in it. He is a good Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, one will ſay, but I have nothing to do with Mathematicks. He is a man who underſtands War well, but I will not wage War with any one. We muſt therefore have a man who can adapt himſelf to all our Affairs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is impoſſible not to love a man thus qualified. But why do we love him? 'Tis becauſe he ſeems to be made for others, and not for himſelf. He trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles not our Self-love by an importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affectation, he pretends not to force us to praiſe him in making appear in him what we would not ſee. If he ſhews us what is good in him, 'tis for us that he ſhews it. Civility rendring us therefore ſenſible of theſe favourable Judgments and Opinions which it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers in the minds of others, by this proceeding forces it ſelf to deſerve them in following it.</p>
               <p n="21">21. We may diſcover by this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame actions may be civil in ſome Men, and not ſo in others. This happens for that they are leſs affected in ſome, and becauſe Self-love ſhews it ſelf leſs, and teſtifies leſs deſire to apply
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:110487:77"/>men to it. Let a man, ſuch an one as Mr. <hi>Vaugelas,</hi> whoſe profeſſion is to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Languages, make a Book wherein he obſerves, both the good, and bad faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſpeaking thoſe which are in uſe at Court, and thoſe which ſmell of the Country, no man can find fault there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: 'Tis a man who makes it his Trade, and he may have had in that a laudable Conſideration to render this Service to the publick. But if it ſhould fall out, for example, that a Prieſt, or a Religious Man being angry at fine wit, would make Collections of ſome words which were ſaid in the ſtreets, and in places which he ought not to know, that he would appear full of eſteem for Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, and for the Converſation of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it could by no means be ſuffered All the world would become Spiritual at his coſt, and whether through malice, or through an opinion of Religion, would make a thouſand reflections upon the diſproportion of ſome thoughts, wherein he might buſie himſelf, from the Holineſs of his Office and his Profeſſion. Inſomuch that when men take delight in his Book, either becauſe there would be ſomething that's good therein, or becauſe there would be ſome body who might
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:110487:77"/>will dealt withall, which is always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, they eſteem the perſon of the Author leſs, and find themſelves diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to chooſe him either for Friend or Counſellor.</p>
               <p n="22">22. It is needleſs to prove that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is yet more removed from affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than meer Civility. For loving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers but not it ſelf, it hath nothing to do but to follow its natural motions, to act with a perfect Civility. It does it ſo much better, by how much it does it more ſincerely, and that there is nothing of counterfeit in it. Whereas this civility of Self-love is for the moſt part not ſo uniform. If civility repreſs it in one part, Self-love ſhews it ſelf ſometimes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo leaves ſome little diſguſt of it ſelf, to thoſe who obſerve it narrowly. But as that happens but againſt its intention, it is aſham'd being aware of it, or rather perceiving that others did obſerve it.</p>
               <p>Thus it is always true to ſay, that when Self-love follows reaſon exactly in the ſearch of eſteem, and affection of Men, it imitates perfectly Charity, ſo that in conſulting it upon exterior acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it makes us the ſame anſwer that Charity does, and engages us in the ſame ways.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:110487:78"/>
               <p n="23">23. If for example, one ask Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in what diſpoſition we ought to be concerning the ſubject of our Faults, ſhe will tell us that we ought extreamly to contemn our ſelves as to our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, in regard of thoſe we think we have not; and that the perſwaſion wherein we ought to be in general of our blindneſs in this Point, ought to diſpoſe us more to believe others in this than our ſelves; But in reſpect of faults which we ſhall be convinced of, there would be nothing more unjuſt than to counterfeit, and deſtroy in ſome ſort the Light of God it ſelf, by pretending to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what it condemns; and thus the leaſt we can do to eſcape this pride ſo criminal, is to acknowledge them ſincerely, and to humble our ſelves before God and Man.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Let us now propoſe the ſame queſtion to Self-love, and we ſhall ſee if it ſpeak not the ſame language at the bottom of the Heart, it gives yet the ſame counſel. Tho it be hard, it will ſay, to acknowledge our faults, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to deface them, and blot them out of the memory of Man, as well as out of our own, it is evident nevertheleſs that that is impoſſible. The more we ſhall ſtrive to diſguiſe them from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:110487:78"/>the more ingenuous they will be to diſcover them, and wicked to make them taken notice of. This ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Concealing them will paſs in their minds for the greateſt of faults, and we ſhall do nothing in ſtriving either to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them or to maintain them, but draw hatred and diſdain upon our ſelves. We muſt therefore neceſſarily ſteer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe. If we cannot have the glory of being without faults, we muſt have that of knowing them, and not being cheats to our ſelves. <hi>Bellum eſt ſua vitia noſſe,</hi> Let us take away then from others the pleaſure of taking notice of them, in obſerving them our ſelves firſt, and thereby diſarming their wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>'Tis upon the like conſiderations that Civility forms its conduct, and 'tis that which carries it to make an open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of acknowledging ſincerely all its Faults, and not to take it ill that others obſerve them, and by this means it gains the reputation of an amiable equity, which makes it judge of it ſelf clearly, and without paſſion, which knows how to juſtifie it ſelf, and with which one may be at quiet, without being obliged out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to teſtifie that one approves, what indeed one approves not.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:110487:79"/>
               <p n="25">25. It is eaſie to be diſcerned by what has been ſaid, that Charity and Self-love ſhould be very conform as to the receiving reprehenſions and advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that ſome very different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and motives ought to unite them in the ſame outward conduct. We know well enough that to which Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſways us; For looking upon theſe Advertiſements, as a very great good, and a favourable means to deliver us from our Faults, Charity receives them not only with joy, but with greedineſs and avidity. The bitterneſs it ſelf which accompanies them is agreeable to it, as procuring us the ſatisfaction of huminity, and weakening Self-love, which Charity eſteems as its worſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Thus 'tis ſo far from ſhewing any diſguſt or ſharpneſs of ſpeech to thoſe who procure us this good, that it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets nothing that may teſtifie its grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; to comfort them in the fear they have of hurting us, to incline them, to do us ſometimes the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and to free them from all doubts which may make them reſerved, and keep them in torment and conſtraint.</p>
               <p n="26">26. In truth Self-love is always inwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very far removed from this diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:110487:79"/>It loves not that others take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our Faults, and much leſs that they admoniſh us of them. But yet it acts outwardly as Charity does. For learning by theſe admonitions which are given us, the bad impreſſion Men have of us, reaſon makes Self-love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude preſently, that it muſt be leſſen'd, or at leaſt not augmented; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting afterwards other mens minds to learn how we ought to guide ours, Self-love eaſily acknowledgeth that nothing is a greater ſtumbling-block than the haughtineſs of thoſe, who are not able to endure to be admoniſh'd of any of their Faults, who rebell againſt Truth and who could wiſh that all the World were blind in reſpect of them, or would ſuppreſs their thoughts, ſo ſoon as they are not for their advantage; and on the contrary nothing is more agreeable to People than to be freed from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and to ſee that they put a ſtop to their judgments, and to their light, and thus in ſome ſort they ſubmit themſelves to their empire. Self-love therefore without heſitating takes this laſt part, and thereby makes us inſinuate our ſelves ſo agreeably into the hearts of thoſe who reprove us, that they love
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:110487:80"/>thoſe who humble themſelves in that manner much better, what faults ſoever they have, than thoſe who having none, have not opportunity to give them this ſatisfaction. Becauſe we muſt obſerve that our faults are not of themſelves contrary to the Self-love of others, and likewiſe that the braveſt qualities of themſelves, are not pleaſing to it. 'Tis the relation theſe faults, and theſe brave qualities have with them. So that if theſe faults make us more humble in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them, or if theſe brave quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties render us more haughty, they will love us with theſe faults, and hate us with all thoſe brave qualities.</p>
               <p n="27">27. It is manifeſt that this conduct aims directly at leaſt at Self-love, which is to obtain the eſteem of the friendſhip of men. And therefore Human civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty never fails to follow it, and often even does it more exactly than true Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, when it is not perfect. Becauſe as Charity is leſs active than Self-love, it happens often alſo that Pious people ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more ſenſible, and more delicate than civil wordly Men, when advertiſed of their faults, which are obſerved in their Conduct, or in their labours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in theſe occurrences, not having
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:110487:80"/>a very lively Charity, they lack alſo this Self-love which is a ſupplement in regard of outward actions.</p>
               <p n="28">28. The conduct which Charity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves towards civil Men, when we are prepoſſeſſed with unjuſt ſuſpicions, and unreaſonable Impreſſions of them, is not to reprove them, and ſhew diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and malice, but to juſtifie them in teſtifying that they are not aſtoniſhed that being Men, they are ſuſpected of human frailties, and in a word not to complain of theſe ſuſpicions, but to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to cure them; becauſe we ought to look upon them as very dangerous for thoſe who have them, and that the way to free them from them, is not to reprove them when they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that they are in the wrong, but to ſhew them gently the falſity of their ſuſpicions to oblige them, by this means to condemn them their own ſelves.</p>
               <p n="29">29. In truth if we follow on theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, the firſt motives of Self-love, we ſhall be very far from this moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They will be on the contrary only paſſions full of reſentments and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But if we conſult Reaſon, with a reſolution to follow it to arrive at laſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:110487:81"/>at laſt at what we ought, which is to blot out theſe ſuſpicions, which are ſo injurious, and to ſtabliſh our reputation in the minds of thoſe who have received them, it is neceſſary that we take the ſame way. Becauſe all that ſeems paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and trouble of the mind, is only ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to increaſe the bad Impreſſions men have harboured of us. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as oftentimes there is only the mind which is prepoſſeſſed therewith, we by bitterneſs carry it into the will it ſelf, and make it endeavour to maintain the Impreſſions of the mind. Thus Self-love foreſeeing this evil effect, is reduced, how unwilling ſoever it may be, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this ſweet and moderate conduct which Charity preſcribes.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Who would ever believe that Self-love, even when it ſhould have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to cry down its enemies, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them odious, and to make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by all the world of baſeneſs, and injuſtice, could not do better to proſper therein, then to follow the ſteps of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Yet this happens very often. For there is nothing for the moſt part, which makes baſe and uncivil proceedings which are uſed towards us, appear bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than to withſtand thoſe by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:110487:81"/>full of civility and moderation. This oppoſition, which ſhews the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theſe two contrary conducts, makes the one and the other more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. Civility appears more lovely on the one ſide, and baſeneſs more ſhamefull on the other. And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Self-love hath all it pretends, which is, that we raiſe our ſelves, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoſe who have offended us.</p>
               <p n="31">31. I remember upon this Subject, that when a certain Book was publiſhed, in which the Author pretended to have gathered together divers and ſundry faults againſt the Language, which he thought he had found in ſome works of Piety, which paſſed for well written, it was examined in a Society by a way of diſcourſe, what thoſe who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein ought to do on this ſcore; Each man agreed preſently that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of this Author being inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ought not to be propoſed againſt the ſame Writings, becauſe there was no other end in it, but that of acquiring the reputation of Writing well; thoſe whom it attacked, ought not to have the leaſt thought of forming a conteſt upon ſo frivolous an occaſion, how much to blame ſoever this Author might be in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:110487:82"/>ſome of his Remarks. But when we came to ſpeak of what they ought to do, we were not of the ſame mind. There were ſome who would maintain, that they ought not to affirm that they had ſeen this Book. But the Generality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that they ought to take other meaſures, and that for full anſwer, they need only correct honeſtly and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the other Editions of thoſe Books, all that this Author had diſallowed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with any gloſs of Juſtice. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which they alledge for it beſides the general motive of honouring Truth in every thing, is, that there was no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way, whereby the Publick can do this Author, and thoſe whom it ſhould have attacked, Juſtice, than by uſing them ſo moderately. I confeſs that I was of this opinion, and that I thought there was none more conform, neither to Charity, which always tends to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us, nor to Self-love, which is glad to place in ſight the faults of thoſe who have a deſire to abaſe us. I will alſo praiſe it very willingly, if I have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to do it, without any pretence whatſoever of obliging any one to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is an act of humility, being I acknowledge that it may very eaſily have another principle.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:110487:82"/>
               <p n="32">32. 'Tis thus that Charity and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility accord together to make appear outwardly the ſame Sentiment, in what regards our good and bad qualities; and it is not hard to judge thereby that they do the ſame in what regards others. We ſee eaſily whereto Charity inclines, in reſpect of the good it obſerves in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. As Charity rejoyces at it inwardly, it teſtifies alſo its joy outwardly all manner of ways poſſible, and far from endeavouring to obſerve it, Charity u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth its power to heighten it and make it eſteemed. Other mens good is its proper good, through the love it bears them, and it ſtops there more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, than at is own, becauſe it fears not therein complacency and vanity.</p>
               <p n="33">33. It would ſeem at firſt that there could be no reaſon to hope the like conduct from Self-love. For it is ſo far from having this goodneſs and kindneſs for others, that on the contrary it is naturally wicked, jealous, envious, full of gall and venom. All that puffs up others Incommodes, and vexes it, and one hardly ſees it really favourable to the praiſes given them, except ſome profit may be drawn from thence, and that they make uſe of it as a ſtep to raiſe themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:110487:83"/>
               <p>But although one perceive in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all theſe motives, nevertheleſs when one conſiders the effect they would make upon the minds of others, if one ſhould ſhew them publickly, one would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly conclude to keep them ſecret. We ſee clearly that that would be the way to make ones ſelf lookt upon as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and publick Enemy, and would thereby become the Object of hatred, and the abomination of all the World. We ſhould not only be odious to thoſe againſt whom we would exerciſe our wickedneſs, but even to thoſe we would ſpare, no body being able to aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to receive Juſtice from people in whom this evil Platform is found, and every one fearing, with reaſon, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the object of their Jealouſie. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility makes us therefore take juſtly the contrary way. It makes us affect to ſhew outwardly an extream equity to praiſe voluntarily what is Praiſe-worthy, to ſet a value as great as we can on other mens good qualities, and not to refuſe even to our Enemies our Teſtimonies of eſteem which they deſerve; and by this means we proſper in the Deſign of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our ſelves beloved, we acquire friends, we pacifie our Enemies, and we
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:110487:83"/>keep a good Correſpondence with all the World.</p>
               <p n="34">34. 'Tis by theſe conſiderations that Civility doth manifeſt an extream Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for other mens faults, and far from exagerating or divulging them, doth hide and excuſe them as much as it can; never contemns any man, expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates all to the beſt, is eaſily ſatisfied, and affects not to be curious and ſubtil in diſcovering peoples faults who are generally eſteem'd, avoids raſh and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded ſuſpicions, and had rather, in ſome ſort, be deceived, then give way to ſuſpicions which are hurtful to its Neighbour. All this tends directly, at leaſt to ſelf-love. For as we cannot be ignorant but that we have faults, we hate much more thoſe whom we judge will Scorn us when they ſhall perceive them, and we cannot on the contrary but love thoſe from whom we hope for ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, condeſcendence and favour.</p>
               <p n="35">35. If Charity be patient in Injuries, becauſe it endeavours to aſſwage the ſharpneſs of thoſe who hurt us, it does it that we may ſuffer all ſorts of bad uſage joyfully, to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, and perſwades us that we deſerve yet worſe. Self-love hath alſo a Patience of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:110487:84"/>and Vanity which outwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the ſame effects. It hinders us for paſſing for proud and preſumptuous. It teaches us, That 'tis good not to vex or provoke people too much, and thereupon makes us diſſemble the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which we receive.</p>
               <p>If Charity be kind through a ſincere deſire of ſerving others, Self-love will alſo that we be ſo, to rule thereby in their minds, and to enjoy the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which theſe good Turns excite therein.</p>
               <p>If Charity endeavour to conceal it ſelf when it does good to others, that it may not attribute any thing to it ſelf, Self-love does as much to enjoy it more fully, becauſe we hold our ſelves ſo much more obliged, by how much more he who does a good turn does it privatly.</p>
               <p>If Charity extend its good turns to thoſe from whom nothing is expected, and even to Enemies, as regarding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their good, and not its own intereſt: Self-love does the ſame, as knowing by how much more good turns do appear diſintereſſed and free from all ſelf-ſeeking; by ſo much more they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a general affection by a hope they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:110487:84"/>give to all the world of receiving the like.</p>
               <p>If Charity be thankful towards the world, becauſe its Gratitude towards God diffuſeth it ſelf over all the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which it makes uſe of to procure us happineſs: Self-love makes us ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire to be ſo, for fear of diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the happineſs of others who expect it, and is troubled when it fails therein.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if Charity makes us faithful towards all the World through a ſincere love of Juſtice, Self-love makes us pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the ſame Fidelity to obtain mens aſſurance.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Charity, as the Apoſtle ſaith, is not ambitious, becauſe thoſe who are ſo, have but little eſteem for human Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and temporal Greatneſs which Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition ſeeks; becauſe they fear them more then they deſire them, and find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alway happy in the condition wherein God hath placed them. We cannot ſay ſo much of human Civility, and if we will judge of it by its <hi>Baſis</hi> or Ground-work, this Civility is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to Ambition, but is indeed nothing elſe but a curious and delicate Ambition, and yet endeavours outwardly to imitate Charity. For it knows ſo well
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:110487:85"/>how to conceal its ambitious deſires, for fear of meeting with oppoſition in the ſelf-love of others, which is always on its Guard on that ſide, that one would ſay, it had not any pretence, that it had only a care for others, and that it had abſolutely forgot it ſelf. If it think of raiſing it ſelf, 'tis without trouble and meanneſs, and it does it ſo well as if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſeemed always to come and find it it ſelf, without being able to make any retreat or any advance to obtain it.</p>
               <p n="37">37. There are ſome likewiſe which ſelf-love puſhes further, and to whom it gives an effective ſeperation from great Fortunes and great Employs, tho poſſibly they might arrive thereunto. The ſatisfaction of a ſweet and quiet life, in which we entertain a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of brave Friendſhips, and render ſervice to many perſons of quality and worth without Intereſt or Dependence in contenting our ſelves to have got in the world the reputation of a Civil, Obliging, Diſintereſſed Man, and a good Friend. This life, I ſay, hath Charms which are able to make it preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the greatneſs in the World, through a wiſe and diſcreet Self-love, and which knows how to compare the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:110487:85"/>advantages and diſadvantages of divers States. This is the <hi>Idea</hi> which <hi>Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Atticus</hi> propoſed to himſelf, and which he followed ſo happily that being found amongſt many diſſenting Parties, who in his time tore in peices the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was always friend to all, and ſerved them without diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any. We ſee yet that there are of <hi>Atticus</hi>'s followers or imitators, and it may be ſaid to their advantage, that if it were permitted or poſſible to be happy in this life, they would have found out the ſecret of it, and that their choice is infinitely wiſer then that of others, who being always deſirous to raiſe themſelves by a boundleſs ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do thereby deprive themſelves of two principal goods of life, which are Security and Repoſe.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Likewiſe it is eaſie to ſee, that as Charity ſeperates us from the pleaſures of the ſenſes, becauſe it keeps the Soul in order, and permits it to cleave to God only; Civility ought to do the ſame, becauſe the ſubjection to Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pleaſures hath always ſomething of mean and contemptible, which debaſes and disfigures the <hi>Idea</hi> of us, which ſelf-love deſires to imprint in the minds of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:110487:86"/>others. We have alſo reaſon to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful of thoſe who are governed by their Paſſions and Pleaſures, and to fear from them all ſort of baſeneſſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries. For what aſſurance can one have that their Paſſion will not overſway them when it ſhall be contrary to their duty towards men, being we ſee it ſways them ſo often in what is their Duty to God.</p>
               <p>Thus Civility, which will above all conſerve the reputation of an inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fidelity, and of an inflexible firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in duties, affects to appear free from this Paſſion for Pleaſures, which gives ſo juſt an occaſion of diſtruſt.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Laſtly, not to urge this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Charity and Self-love to a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome reherſal, I ſhall content my ſelf to add what I have ſaid of it, that it is very true that Self-love may imitate all the Actions of Charity, and inſinuate it ſelf often into thoſe wherein it ſeems it may have the leaſt ſhare, and which are deſign'd to mortifie and to deſtroy it.</p>
               <p>It can ſometimes make religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Faſt, or at leaſt aſſwage one part of the trouble of their Faſt. The hair Cloaths and Diſcipline are ſometimes for their uſe, and there is hardly any
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:110487:86"/>humiliation which Self-love is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to practice; and although it find not its accompt in ſolitude, in ſilence, and in ſecret Auſterities, there are perchance certain hidden paſſages and certain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous ways, through which it might (may be) find ſome entrance. In fine ſelf-love is alſo capable to make us ſuffer even death with joy; and to the end that there may be no certain way to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from Charity by Martyrdoms, the Saints do teach us after St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that there are Martyrs of Vanity as well as of Charity. Therefore St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> having ſaid, <hi>That Vanity doth imitate ſo exactly the works of Charity, that there is almoſt no difference at all betwixt their effects, that Charity doth nouriſh the Poor, and that Vanity doth ſo likewiſe; that Charity Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Vanity can Faſt alſo; that theſe works do ſtrike us, but that we cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh which come from a good and which from an ill Principle. He adds at laſt that Charity dyes, and brings us at the end to Martyrdom, and that Vanity dyes alſo and ſuffereth Martyrdom. Videte qualia opera faciat Superbia, quam ſimilia faciat &amp; prope paria Charitati. Paſcit Eſurientem Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, Paſcit &amp; Superbia, Charitas ut Deus laudetur, Superbia ut ipſa laudetur. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junat
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:110487:87"/>Charitas, jejunat &amp; Superbia. Opera videmus, in operibus non diſcernimus. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur Charitas, Moritur Superbia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="40">40. But there is this difference betwixt the hard, troubleſome and humbling actions of Vertue, and thoſe which have nothing but what is beautifull without being troubleſom, that when Self-love perſwades Men to humility, patience, and to ſuffering, 'tis by a kind of unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualneſs or diſorder. For it is evident, for example, that the way to attain to our end, which we propoſe, is not to ſhut our ſelves up in ſolitude to have no converſe with Men, or to have nothing ſpoken of but our ſins and faults. And thus it is almoſt impoſſible that there be any who embrace this kind of life ſo contrary to the inclinations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and who perſevere therein by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther motives, than thoſe of Salvation. But it is not the ſame with the moſt part of the actions of Vertue, which may be done in the world. Self-love obtains its ends better by practiſing them. It cannot omit them without looſing what it aims at: And it muſt be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by ſome unreaſonable paſſion againſt its true Intereſts, to follow any other road but this.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:110487:87"/>
               <p n="41">41. Thus one may ſay truly, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to reform the World, that's to ſay to baniſh all the Vices, and all the groſs diſorders therein, and to make Mankind happy even in this life, there needs only inſtead of Charity, to give every one a harmleſs Self-love, which may be able to diſcen its true Intereſts, and to incline thereto by the ways which true Reaſon ſhall diſcover to it. How corrupt ſoever this whole Society may be within, and in the ſight of God, there would be nothing without better ordered, more civilly, more juſt, more peaceable, more honeſt, more generous; and what would be more admirable, 'tis that not being animated and ſtir'd but by Self-love, Self-love would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at all there, and being abſolutely void of Charity, we ſhould ſee every where nothing but the form and chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Charity.</p>
               <p n="42">42. Perhaps it would not be amiſs, that thoſe who are charged with the Education of great Perſons, ſhould have this engraven in their minds, to the end that if they ſhould not be able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them with theſe ſentiments of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which they would gladly do, they ſhould endeavour at leaſt to form their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:110487:88"/>Self-love, and teach them how the moſt part of the ways which they take to content this Self-love are falſe, ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and contrary to their true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and how it would be facile for them to take ſome others, which would conduct them without trouble to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, and would get them the affection, the eſteem, and the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the World. If they ſhould not proſper by this means to render them uſefull to themſelves, they would at leaſt make them uſefull for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and would put them in a way which would always be leſs remote from the way to Heaven, than that which they take, ſeeing that it would be only to change the end, and the intention, to render themſelves as agreeable to God by a truly Chriſtian vertue; as they would be to Man by the ſplendor of this human Civility to which we would form them.</p>
               <p n="43">43. But it would be of little or no moment that theſe two Principles ſo different, the one whereof bears the fruits of Life, the other of Death, ſhould be confounded in the outward A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, at leaſt if it were eaſie for every one to know diſtinctly that which makes
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:110487:88"/>him do it, to the end that he may be able to judge thereby of his actions and condition. What is more ſtrange, is, that many times this mixture and this confuſion begins in the heart it ſelf, ſo that we cannot diſtinguiſh whether 'tis through Charity or Self-love that we act, whether 'tis God or our ſelves we ſeek for, whether 'tis for Heaven or Hell we labour. This obſcurity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from divers cauſes; and I will take notice here of the three principall ones.</p>
               <p n="44">44. The firſt is that theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the judgments of men, and the motions of their hearts in regard of us which are the rule, the ſource, and the object of human Civility, are not always accompanied with formal and expreſs reflections, and that the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they produce are yet more imperceptible to us. Theſe are often in reſpect of the mind, only as certain looks, and certain tranſitory thoughts by which it is carried, as by ſtealth towards theſe Judgments, which are made of us, and in reſpect of the heart only as certain hidden Propenſities, which ſtop it gently on this ſide; ſo that we do not make any expreſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:110487:89"/>neither on this propenſity, nor on the thoughts which produceth it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that may be the thing which gives the motion to our outward A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and which is the Principle thereof.</p>
               <p n="45">45. The ſecond is that it may often happen, that even when we are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved in effect but through fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing men, or through a deſire to pleaſe them. We have not abſolutely any knowledge, nor any diſtinct thoughts, neither of the one nor the other; and that becauſe we act often without a diſtinct knowledge, and by a ſimple cuſtome, which is not guided, unleſs by confuſed thoughts, being forced to look upon certain actions, as able to bring upon us publick infamy, and the hatred of honeſt men, it forms it ſelf in the mind a confuſed Idea thereof, which repreſents them to us as hatefull and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, without troubling the mind why. And this Idea ſufficeth to ſtir up in the heart a motion of horror, averſion and ſeparation. Now the confuſed Idea's, and theſe motions which follow them, come ſo near to the true conſiderations of Charity, which make it hate the evil actions which they include, that there
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:110487:89"/>is hardly any but God who can diſcern the difference betwixt them.</p>
               <p n="46">46. The third is, that even when we have Charity in the heart, and that it carries us to objects which are proper for it, nevertheleſs becauſe cupidity marcheth many times the ſame ways, and tends to the ſame objects, tho by different motives, it makes a Hotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potch in the Mind, and in the heart of theſe two conſiderations and motions, without our knowing certainly which it is that carries it, and which is the true principle of our Actions. We ſeek God and the World at once; the heart is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad to pleaſe the one and the other, and knows, not whether 'tis God he relates to the World, or the World to God. This difference cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, but by penetrating a certain Groundplot which is in the heart, and which is not evidently known but by God alone.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Behold what is the ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Men in this life, even when they love God. Self-love acts more groſly in ſome than others, but it lives and acts in all to ſuch a degree, and it is ſeldom that they are able to aſſure themſelves of any one action in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:110487:90"/>that it is exempt from all ſelf-inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. But tho this ſtate and condition may be for them a great cauſe of grief and fear, they may be able neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to find therein ſome Conſolation, if they dive into the reaſons for which God permits them to remain there, and raiſes not them to a higher degree of Vertue.</p>
               <p n="48">48. It is viſible in the firſt place that the deſign which God hath to conceal the Kingdom of Heaven, which he came to eſtabliſh upon Earth, requires that men of Honeſty and uprightneſs be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt outwardly with wicked men, and that they be not diſtinguiſhed from them by clear and viſible marks. For if the faithfull, whom he animates by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in whom he reſides as in his Temple, were a certain kind of men, ſeparated from others, and as a Nation apart which the World might diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh by actions which could not be met with in others, they would all be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, continual and ſubſiſting miracles, which would deſtroy the ſtate of Faith, by which God will ſave the World. The wicked who would ſee themſelves in an impoſſibility of imitating them, would thereby clearly know, that Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:110487:90"/>attain to the ſtate of vertuous Men. Therefore there muſt be ſome actions purely Human, which do ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble ſupernatural and divine Actions, that the diſtinction cannot be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And as theſe well-meaning men do not commit any crimes, and thus cannot be thereby intermixed together with the wicked; It muſt neceſſarily follow, that the wicked can imitate their vertuous Actions, and do ſome which may be ſo like outwardly; that they cannot be diſcovered from the others.</p>
               <p n="49">49. But it is not only an effect of Gods Juſtice to withdraw from the ſight of wicked men the treaſures of Grace, which he gives to the Juſt. This is one of his Mercies alſo towards the Juſt themſelves. It is good for them not to know themſelves, nor to ſee their own proper Juſtice. The ſight would be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to overwhelm them. Man is ſo weak and feeble even in his force, that he is not able to undergo the weight of it. And by a ſtrange diſorder which hath its ſource in the corruption of the Heart, altho its happineſs conſiſts in the poſſeſſion of Vertue, and its mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune in being full of faults, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:110487:91"/>more dangerous for him to know his vertues than his faults. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of humility renders him proud, and that of his pride humble. He is ſtrong and powerfull when he knows himſelf weak, and weak when he thinks he is ſtrong. Thus this obſcurity which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes and hinders him from diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clearly whether he acts by Charity, or by Self-love, is ſo far from hurting, that 'tis comfortable to him. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity does not take away Vertues from him, but hinders him from looſing them, by keeping him always in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and fear, and making him miſtruſt all his Works, and to rely only on Gods Mercy.</p>
               <p n="50">50. This is the great profit of this outward reſemblance of the actions of Self-love, with thoſe of Charity. But we may yet take notice of ſome others which are very material. It happens oftentimes that Charity is weak in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Souls, and in this condition of weakneſs Charity would be eaſily extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by theſe violent tentations, if God did not permit that theſe tentations were not enervated, and as it were counterpoiſed by certain human motives, which ſtop the violence of it, and give
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:110487:91"/>means to the Soul to follow the inſtinct of Grace. The fear of mens judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is one of theſe motives, and there is hardly any of them which make more impreſſion upon the Mind. Fear alone is not ſufficient for Charity to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount temptations in a Chriſtian way, ſeeing that this fear ſprings only from vanity, but it ſuſpends their force, and if it be found that the Soul hath ſome ſpark of true Charity, it puts her in a condition of following it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee that the Holy Legiſlators of Religious Orders have not been negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in theſe human means, and that they have fixed to certain faults, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which were dreadfull before men, to the end that the fear of this Human confuſion may render the Religious more diligent in avoiding them. 'Tis not that they would pretend to make them do them by this ſole motive, but their intention hath been, that they ſhould make uſe thereof to fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt negligence, and that this Human fear might ſerve as arms to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the better by this means to reſiſt the inclination of Nature.</p>
               <p n="51">51. It is not then unprofitable for Men in the ſtate of weakneſs, wherein
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:110487:92"/>they are to be far removed from vices, not only by Charity, but alſo by this kind of Self-love which is called Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the end that in the feebleneſs of charity Civility may be able to uphold the Mind, and hinder it from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dangerous exceſſes. And 'tis this which makes us ſee often ſtrange Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in thoſe, who being little ſenſible of mens judgments, and not thinking of pleaſing or diſpleaſing them are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times touched with ſome ſmall motions of Piety. Becauſe when it happens that they want theſe motions, not having then curb enough to ſtop them, they let themſelves be hurried away to all ſorts of Extravagancies. Thus when one relies upon Men, it is good to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider if beſides Conſcience which keeps them from evil, they have yet a certain Civility, which makes them apprehend doing things which may be condemned by wiſe and prudent Perſons, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardly any ſpirits more dangerous, than thoſe who are capable of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unreaſonable and extravagant conduct againſt the Publick Judgment, and of placing themſelves without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon above the reproach of thoſe who know them.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:110487:92"/>
               <p n="52">52. Is it not a great and conſiderable advantage to Civil men to be able to conceal themſelves from men by the means of this obſcurity which hinders one from diſcerning true Piety, from Self-love, and which makes actions of Charity paſs in the mind of the World for the effects of pure Civility? For how dangerous would it be for them, if all their good actions were taken notice of, and that they were recompenced for them out of hand by praiſes which they would bring them? It would be the means to oblige them to ſeperate themſelves entirely from the ſociety of Men; whereas by the favour of this confuſion they have ſome more liberty to treat with the World, to follow on all occaſions the motions of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in hopes that they will be taken only as ſimple and meer Civilities. In a word one may ſay, that as Civility is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad to paſs for Charity, and that it doth all it can to borrow its form and ſhape, and its characters; Charity on the contrary is glad that it may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Civility, and altho it does not contribute directly to eſtabliſh this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, yet it does nothing to deſtroy it, as well becauſe it knows not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

               <p n="53">53. Laſtly, is not this a motive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful enough to ſtir us up to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Virtues, to ſay to ones ſelf, <hi>I ſhould be very unfortunate to wander and ſtray out of the way whereto Charity and Self-intereſt equally inclines me, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſelf, in forſaking them, equally odious to God and man.</hi> Is not this a means to praiſe God, that he hath been pleaſed to forbid us the moſt part of Diſorders, as contrary to the good of men even in this life, and ought to be avoided for the ſame motive of human intereſt? In fine is not this a means to underſtand better the ſtrange corruption of nature and the violence of our paſſions, to ſee that they make us forget not only what we owe to God, but alſo what we owe to our ſelves, and render us unfortunate Both in this World and in the other? Becauſe if there be leſs glory and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in ſerving God, when it is for our Intereſt, there is, without doubt, more diſorder and confuſion not to ſerve him, when we deprive our ſelves at the ſame time of what Intereſt it ſelf cauſeth us to deſire, and diligently to ſeek for, as being our own proper advantage.</p>

The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition that God hath made us of Tempting him is properly of this kind. Few perſons are ignorant that God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by orders us not to be idle when we have in our power human means which we can employ. But as we know not
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:110487:95"/>why God forbids us to neglect theſe human means, we reſt there, and we heed by ſo much the leſs to inſtruct our ſelves in this Precept, by how much it ſeems that there is nothing more rare than to tempt God in this manner; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man underſtanding being infinitely more inclin'd to fix it ſelf too much to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man means, through a want of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, then to neglect them through an Exceſs of Truſt. 'Tis this which gives a belief that it would not be unprofitable to explicate at large what it is to tempt God, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Grounds and Principles of the Prohibition which God makes us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is not only Soveraignly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, he is alſo Soveraignly Wiſe in his Conduct. As being powerful he is the chief Original of all things, whether in the corporal and viſible World, or in the inviſible or Spiritual World. As being wiſe he operates all things by certain means, and in a certain order, which is not leſs eſſential to his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than the Power it ſelf by which he operates them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The pride and diſorder of Men tend equally to withdraw them from the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:110487:95"/>Power and Wiſdom of God; as ſolid Piety tends to humble them more and more to the one and the other. To withdraw themſelves from this Power, ſome have denied abſolutely the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the Operation of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in natural things, like the Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans. Others have denied it in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, and in the actions of our Souls, which lead us to Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery, like the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> And others not daring to go to this exceſs of Impiety, have not ſtuck to deny it him in the diſtinction of good Men and bad, in the Elect and Reprobate, like the <hi>Semipelagians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But the manner how Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves from the Wiſdom of God, being no leſs criminal, is much more unknown. And 'tis this which they call tempting of God which is a ſin few people comprehend.</p>
               <p>It depends in the withdrawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the order of God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to make it act according to our phantaſie, in neglecting the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the means, to which he fixeth ordinarily the effects of his Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And to conceive in what manner we fall thereinto, as to what regards
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:110487:96"/>the life of the Soul, 'tis but to conſider how we may fall thereinto, as to what regards the life of the body.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is manifeſt, that 'tis God who maintains our being and our Life; and that he is not leſs properly the cauſe thereof, than if he made it ſubſiſt by a viſible Miracle, independant of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior means. We maintain it by food! But who is it that produceth this food? <hi>It was not,</hi> ſaith St. Auguſtin, <hi>neither my Mother, nor my Nurſes, who repleniſhed their breaſts for me with milk which they gave me, but it was thee, O Lord: It was only thee, who gave me by their help the nouriſhment I had need of according to the natural Order which thou haſt eſtabliſhed, and according to the riches of thy Bounty and Providence, who diffuſeſt thy Cares e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the moſt ſecret Principles, and the moſt hidden cauſes of the ſubſiſtance of thy Creatures. Thou art the Author of all Good, O my God, and I owe thee all the Conſervation of my life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether he make us live after this manner, or after an extraordinary and miraculous manner, 'tis always he who acts and maintains us. And thus we are obliged to acknowledge his All-powerfull Hand and Operation, whether
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:110487:96"/>he conceal or diſcloſe it. But yet there is this difference betwixt theſe two ways, whereby he acts upon the Souls and bodies. That the firſt is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way by which he guides his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the other an extraordinary way whereof he ſeldom makes uſe, and which hath no certain rules. 'Tis in the firſt that the order of Providence, which he permits men to know, conſiſts; and the ſecond includes only certain ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and cauſes which of our ſelves we can never foreſee, becauſe the counſels according to which God produceth them at one time, and does not produce them at another, are too ſublime for the wit of man.</p>
               <p n="7">7. His Wiſdom being therefore debaſed to hide ordinarily his divine Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by human means, it is juſt that men ſhould humble themſelves by theſe means, and it is a great pride in them to neglect them, and to pretend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain God to act in an extraordinary manner, of which he hath not made us capable of penetrating to the bottom. 'Tis this which is properly called tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, as Jeſus Chriſt teacheth us in the Goſpel. For the Devil urging him to caſt himſelf from the top of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:110487:97"/>to the bottom, in alledging to him that 'tis written; <hi>that God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Angels to uphold the Juſt, and to hinder them from hurting themſelves againſt the ſtones,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt reſiſted him, telling him, that 'tis written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God,</hi> ſuppoſing that it would be tempting God, to pretend that he ought to cauſe his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to uphold a Juſt Man, who ſhould expoſe himſelf raſhly to this danger in leaving the common way which conſiſts in avoiding it.</p>

                  <q>Holy Doctrine teacheth us, ſaith he, that when we are able to employ theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man means, 'tis to tempt God to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them; the Redeemer wanted not power to ſecure his Diſciples by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and yet he ordered them that if they were perſecuted in one City, to flie to another, and he hath been willing alſo to ſhew them the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Conduct in his own Perſon. For altho he was Maſter abſolutely of his life, and that no man could take it away without his conſent, he hath not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:110487:97"/>omitted in his Infancy to flie death by flight, in cauſing his Parents to carry him into <hi>Egypt.</hi> The Goſpel alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that once he would not go pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> altho at other times he had ſpoken to the <hi>Jews</hi> without hiding himſelf, even when they were the moſt in wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and heard what he ſaid to them with more hatred, becauſe they were not able to lay hands upon him, his time not being come. 'Tis not that that time could force him to die, but 'tis becauſe he had choſen it willingly to ſuffer the <hi>Jews</hi> to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life. Thus he hath ſhewn the power of a God, when inſtructing and reproving his enemies publickly, he did not permit their rage to have any power over him; but in flying and hiding himſelf he hath inſtructed the weakneſs of Man not to tempt God in neglecting to do what he was able to guard himſelf from the miſchiefs which he ought to avoid. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not deſpair of Gods Help, nor had not loſt Faith, when he cauſed himſelf to be let down in a Basket from the top of the walls of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> to free himſelf from
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:110487:98"/>falling into the hands of his enemies, and his flight did not denote that his Faith was void, but only that he would not tempt God, as he ſhould have done, in omitting this means of ſaving himſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. 'Tis yet by the ſame Principles, and by the ſame examples that this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Doctor doth confute, in the Book he writ <hi>of the Labour of Religions,</hi> the vain imaginations of certain <hi>Affrican</hi> Monks who would not labour, becauſe it is ſaid in the Goſpel, <hi>that God doth nouriſh the fowls of the air, altho they neither ſow nor reap,</hi> in eſtabliſhing againſt them this admirable Rule which forbids men to tempt God; and at the ſame time teaches them not to be leſs unmindfull of him, when he nouriſhes them by their labour, then if he procured them their food without contributing to it at all on their part. <q>If there happen, ſaith he, to us infirmities and troubles, which hinder us from labouring, we ought to hope that God will feed us as he doth the fowls in the air, and clothe us as he clothes the Lillies, neither the fowls nor lillies contributing any any thing thereunto. But being in a condition to labour, we ought not to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:110487:98"/>tempt God by neglecting to do it; being the power of doing it is a gift of God, ſo that in procuring by this means what is neceſſary to keep us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; 'tis alwas from God we receive it, becauſe 'tis from him we receive the power of labouring for our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Thus it would be to tempt God to refuſe what is neceſſary to keep us alive, under pretence that God can keep us alive without the help of food. A Governour would tempt God if he ſhould not make preparation to defend the place he hath Command of, againſt the enemy; under pretence that it is written; <hi>If God defend not the City, the Guard watcheth in vain.</hi> For altho he can conſerve it in effect, as he did <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> again the Army of <hi>Sennacherib;</hi> yet the ordinary way whereby he ſaved the Cities, was to inſpire the Captains with vigilance, and the Souldiers with courage. And generally it may be ſaid, that all dull and lazy People in ſome ſort tempt God; becauſe they neglect the means by which Gods Grace and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance is obtained.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Nor is there any but God who knows all the reaſons why he conceals
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:110487:99"/>his operations under certain cauſes, which appear all Natural. We know only ſome of them. By this means he withdraws men from idleneſs, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges them to vigilance and labour, he employs and exerciſes them, he puniſhes them by theſe painfull and laborious employments, he makes them ſet a great value on thoſe things which coſt them moſt pains. But it may be ſaid that one of his principal deſigns, is, to hide himſelf, and to make his conduct unknown to thoſe who are unworthy to know it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If he did always act after a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous manner, we ſhould be as it were forced to acknowledge him in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, and this evidence would not be conform neither to his Juſtice nor Mercy: He is by his Juſtice to ſuffer the wicked to continue in the dark, which inclines and makes them doubt of his Providence, and of his Being, and he is by his Mercy to keep his Choſen pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately from vanity by this wholſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.</p>
               <p>The life of Faith which is the life of the Juſt in this world, conſiſting then in ſerving God without ſeeing him in a ſenſible manner, it is evident that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:110487:99"/>continual miracles would deſtroy this ſtate abſolutely.</p>
               <p>Thus it is neceſſary that God act on one part, and on the other that we do not know his action ſenſibly, he muſt hide himſelf under a certain means, which would appear as it were natural; and which being always expoſed to view, ſhould not ſtir up their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it might only be diſcovered by thoſe whoſe eyes he ſhould open by a Light which he gives to whom he ſhall think fit.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But if it were neceſſary that God ſhould conceal himſelf in this manner in the Order of Nature, and in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward effects he produceth on the body, it were not leſs neceſſary that he ſhould conceal himſelf in his inward Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Soul; becauſe the evidence of the Divine Operation in theſe kind of actions, withdraws not the Soul leſs from the ſtate of Faith, by which he deſires that ſhe ſhould work out her Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in this life. And therefore he gives not ordinarily his greateſt Graces, but by a conſequent of means which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear quite Human and ordinary, and which ſeem humanly proportioned to the end for which they are ordained.</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:110487:100"/>
               <p>He wills us to deſire Vertues, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to acquire them, to ſeek out means to practiſe them, to ſeparate our ſelves from things which may carry us to ſin. 'Tis he who breathes theſe deſires into us, who operates in us theſe labours and pains, and who makes us lop off theſe impediments. It would be facile for him to give us Vertue without this conſequent means, but in giving them us in this order, and by theſe means he hides himſelf from us, and conſerves us in humility.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In the ſame manner he might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe us every moment what we have to do; but if he did in this manner it would be a Conduct viſibly miraculous. He wills us then that we foreſee our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and our words, that we conſider them before him, that we may govern them according to his Laws; and that we may employ all the care we poſſibly can to acknowledge what he wills us, and requires of us in each rencounter. He himſelf is the Author of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, of this Enquiry, of this Care; and he makes uſe of them, as an ordinary means to communicate to us the Wiſdom which we have need of for our Conduct.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:110487:100"/>
               <p n="15">15. 'Tis true that Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, that they ought not to be troubled for what they ſhall ſay to Kings and Princes when they ſhall force them to appear before them, becauſe it ſhall be given to them even at the hour it ſelf what they ought to anſwer them. But Jeſus Chriſt's deſign in this admonition was only to exclude the foreſeeings and the reflections of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair and Self-love: And he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpoſe them not to be aſtoniſhed, when they are obliged to ſpeak to Kings, being unprepared, then to forbid them to prepare themſelves for it. Likewiſe when Jeſus Chriſt forbad his Diſciples to be troubled at the want of food and clothes, he did not forbid them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fathers, reaſonable care and precautions, nor obliged them to expect that God ſhould procure them the one and the other by extraordinary ways; he only commanded them to baniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes and diſtruſts from their hearts, which are hurtfull to his Providence, and to his Bounty and Goodneſs, which hinder them from ſeeking the Kingdom of God before all other things.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Thus there be often apparent contrarieties in Chriſtian Truths, when
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:110487:101"/>we only look upon them with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſight which diſappears and vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, when penetrated to the bottom.</p>
               <p>We may believe, for example, to follow only the firſt Light which ſprings from an imperfect knowledge of Truth, that Chriſtian Life being a Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life, and which is above all human ſtrength, we ought not rather to chooſe one kind of life more than another, nor to trouble our ſelves to avoid the occaſions of ſinning. We can do all with God, one will ſay, but we can do nothing without his help. Thus with the aid and help of God I can continue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in the moſt dangerous occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and without this aid I cannot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my ſelf in the moſt ſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats.</p>
               <p>But thoſe who ſpeak in this manner, comprehend not the ſecret of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Grace. 'Tis true, God is able to boye us up in the greateſt perils; and he does it ſometimes when 'tis he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who ingages us therein; but 'tis but ſeldom that he gives his Grace in ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous a manner. Thus to make us reſiſt temptations, he inſpires into us the care and means to avoid them. This is the ordinary way, and whoever ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:110487:101"/>it hath no right to pretend that God upholds him after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p n="17">17. If one were ordinarily as recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in buſineſs, as in quiet and repoſe; If one ſunk down oftentimes no more in temptations living in the occaſions of ſin, than in the way of avoiding them; If one contracted no more ſpots in trading with the World, than by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a retired life; If great Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſwayed us not more to vanity, that mean and baſe employments; it would undoubtedly be a kind of viſible miracle, God acteth in this ſort when he pleaſeth, for ſome choſen Souls. But as he will not that his Conduct over us, appear ſo viſibly miraculous, he does it not very often, and he obliges us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to reduce our ſelves to the ordinary way, and to prefer as much as we can repoſe before action, a retired life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great Employs; And laſtly, the flying all occaſions, before a confidence which leads us to expoſe our ſelves thereto. Not that it not as facile for God to ſave as well in one manner as another, but he hath taught us that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily he ſaves us in the ſecond man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becauſe he is there more private
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:110487:102"/>and leſs known; and by that means he obligeth us to reduce our ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p n="18">18. 'Tis upon this method of Grace, and this conſequence of means under which God hides his Supernatural Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that all the Rules, and all the Spiritual Counſels are grounded, which the Saints inſpir'd by God, have given to thoſe whom they have conducted in theſe means.</p>
               <p>Theſe great Saints are not ignorant that 'tis from him all Virtues muſt be expected, and that he is the cauſe of all the good actions Chriſtians perform. They were perſwaded that he is the Maſter of mens Hearts, and that he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates in them what he will by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible and an All-powerfull force. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they preſcribe Rules and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, as Philoſophers might do, who would pretend to obtain Virtue by their own proper force. They will have us to keep our minds always buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout holy thoughts; that we apply our ſelves without intermiſſion to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to the ſtudying the Word of God; that we live as it were ſeparate from the World; that we reduce our bodies into bondage by labour and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:110487:102"/>that we avoid all that may weaken us, or be an occaſion of our fall; that we make a continual tryal upon our ſelves to reſiſt our paſſions; that we lead a life uniform, orderly, and not idle, paſſing by an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of actions preſcribed us, as more conform to our condition and to our duty. 'Tis not that they did not know perfectly, that God is able to beſtow on us his greateſt Graces without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us paſs through theſe exerciſes, but they knew at the ſame time that the common order of his Providence is, not to grant us them, but perſuant to theſe exerciſes, and by theſe exerciſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and thus he grants in the firſt place to Souls the Grace to practiſe them, to make them afterwards to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to the Vertues whereunto he deſires to raiſe them, being the Author as well of the actions which he makes them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to acquire theſe Vertues, as of Vertues which they acquire by theſe actions.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Nor is there any thing more eaſie to God then to make us know from time to time our faults, by the infuſion of a Light which will place them at once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes. He might likewiſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:110487:103"/>us for them in giving us contrary Vertues, without our being obliged to be troubled continually at the ſight of our Miſeries. But the Saints who know the ways which God makes uſe of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to cleanſe Souls, forget not to recommend to us this diligent examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and care of our Souls, as one of the chief Duties of Piety, which ought not to end but with our life. <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine, in expecting the coming of this happy day,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hom.</hi> 15.</note> wherein we ſhall be joyned with the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to Praiſe God for all Eternity; In ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting till we be arrived at this ineffable joy which we hope for, let us apply our ſelves as much as we can to the Practice of good Works; let us daily examin our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and carefully look that there be nothing broken and torn in the Spiritual Robes of our Souls, that we have not received ſome ſpots through Intemperance, that we have not burnt them through Choler, nor divided them through Envy, that we have not tarniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Luſtre through Avarice. Let us make haſt to Cure theſe Wounds of our Souls, whileſt we have yet the Power with the and of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. The great St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> whom God hath given particularly to his Church,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:110487:103"/>to inſtruct her with Rules of a ſpiritual life, recommends nothing ſo much in his Morals as this Vigilance and Care of our ſelves, and this diligent examination of good and bad actions. <hi>We muſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>purifie the Actions even of Virtue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Greg. Mor.</hi> l. 1. <hi>c.</hi> 17 &amp; 18.</note> 
                  <hi>by an exact diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, for fear of taking bad for good, and what is imperfect and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive for very perfect. 'Tis that which is hinted to us by the Sacrifice which</hi> Job <hi>Offered for each of his Children. For 'tis Offering a Sacrifice to God for each of his Children to Offer him prayers for each Act of Virtue; for fear that Wiſdom ſhould puff him up, that Intelligence ſhould make him ſtray, that Prudence ſhould puzle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found him, that Force ſhould make him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous. And becauſe</hi> Holocauſt <hi>is a Sacrifice which is abſolutely conſumed, 'tis neceſſary that our Soul be burnt by the fire of Compunction, and that ſhe conſume in this fire all that ſhe hath of impure in her thoughts. But no man is able to do it, if he be not careful to examin all his inward motions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be proceed to Actions.</hi> This Saint ſaith yet,<note place="margin">Ibid. c. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>We muſt bruiſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, that is to ſay conſider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part all that paſſeth in the Soul, and reduce it as it were into duſt by this examination.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:110487:104"/>We muſt take off the skin of the Victim, and cut it into bits, that is to ſay we muſt take from our Actions this outward Surface, which makes them appear to us virtuous, that we may ſee even to the bottom of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This inſtruction is often repeated in St. <hi>Gregories</hi> Works, that one may ſay that 'tis the principal Foundation of his ſpiritual Conduct, and far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting the Juſt more advanced in this Practice, he on the contrary placeth their advancement in the encreaſing this Care and Vigilance, and in this attention upon themſelves.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> hath writ four Books to bring Souls to this exerciſe of examining their Actions and Conduct before God; and he makes it the cheif Duty of a Chriſtian life; but to ſhew in a word the <hi>Idea</hi> he had of true Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, he ſays, <hi>That 'tis to apply ones ſelf to conſider what one is. Quid eſt Pietas? Vacare Conſiderationi;</hi> and that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration conſiſts in foreſeeing ones acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to regulate them before God, to correct ones faults, and to think what is ones Duty. And 'tis remarkable that this Saint gives not theſe inſtructions to a Novice, but to a great Pope, whom
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:110487:104"/>he ought to imagin in a ſtate of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, having been raiſed to this firſt dignity of the Church for his eminent Virtues.</p>
               <p n="22">22. When the Philoſophers, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that Virtue hath no other Source but Nature, preſcribed Rules to attain it, they preſcribed no other then theſe above. They recommended to us, like theſe Saints, this examination, and this continual care and vigilance over our actions, as may be ſeen in the Verſes attributed to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and in ſeveral places of <hi>Seneca.</hi> Did not St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and St. <hi>Barnard</hi> know that Virtue is a pure effect of the mercy of God, and not of our endeavours and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections? Doubtleſs they knew it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they taught it in ſo many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Books; but likewiſe they knew that God did not give it ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to men, but by the practice of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain means and exerciſes, to which he applies them by his Grace. And thus the principal care of thoſe who have the Charge of Souls is to put them in the way of practicing theſe means, by which they may obtain God's Grace, and that it is tempting him to act otherways, and to deſire that he may grant us
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:110487:105"/>them by ſome other way then that which his Wiſdom hath choſen, and which he hath given us to underſtand by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of all the Saints.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Wherefore do men believe that the Fathers have teſtified ſo much doubt of thoſe who do not think of being converted, except at the hour of death? Is it becauſe 'tis not as eaſie for God to touch ſinners by his Grace at the laſt moment as at another time; or that that of death is excluded from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Promiſe, which God hath made to Men to receive them into his Grace if they be Converted ſincerely? Without doubt 'tis nothing of that, God is alway equally powerfull, and the boſom of his Mercy is always equally open to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sinners. But 'tis becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have thought that theſe Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were not generally ſpeaking ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and that they were rather an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the ſtate wherein they found themſelves, than an alteration of the heart. And the reaſon of it is, that in the common way the Heart doth not change thus all at once the object and the end. Outward Actions may be changed eaſily in an inſtant; but Love which holds the principal place of the Heart
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:110487:105"/>ſcarcely changes in an inſtant. It muſt, ordinarily ſpeaking, be diſcouraged by little and little, and that there be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to take its place by divers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes. 'Tis thus that Human paſſions are changed, and God who wills that the Operations of his Grace be not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, follows commonly the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. He begins to ſhake the Heart through fear, before he touch it with his Love, and he often touches it a long time by beginnings of Love, before he makes himſelf maſter of it by a ruling Love, which turns the heart towards him as towards its laſt end, and which frees and delivers it from the bondage of the love of Creatures. Thus as the Converſion of dying ſinners cannot paſs through theſe degrees, it muſt be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous to be true. The Church deſpairs not of this Miracle, which is the reaſon why ſhe grants the Sacraments to dying People: But ſhe fears mightily that theſe Sentiments which appear in ſinners in this ſtate, are only thoſe light begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings either of the Fear or of the Love of God, which are not ſufficient for a true and hearty Converſion. And 'tis this which obliges ſinners not only to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:110487:106"/>labour, but alſo to make haſt to labour ſeriouſly for their Salvation; that their love may have time to increaſe, and to arrive unto a condition that one may be able to ſay they are truly Converted. To act otherways is to tempt God, nay, and to tempt him after a moſt dangerous manner, in willing him to do a Miracle in the Order of his Grace, to ſave us. And in this faſhion all thoſe who expect to be Converted to God at their death, beſides their other ſins, do yet commit that of tempting God, which often cauſes the very utmoſt of it.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Spiritual Riches are all gratis as from God, and yet it is written; That the hands of thoſe who labour ſtrongly heap up Riches. <hi>Manus fortium divities parat.</hi> And the Scripture attributes on the contrary Spiritual poverty to the want of this Labour. <hi>Egeſtatem operata eſt manus remiſſa,</hi> that is to ſay, that negligence and ſloth cauſe the poverty, and the miſery of Souls; ſo great a care hath God to hide the works of his Grace under the reſemblance of thoſe of Nature.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Prayer is doubtleſs that of all Chriſtian actions wherein the need of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:110487:106"/>Grace appears moſt. Therefore the Spirit of God is called by a particular Title, the Spirit of Prayers, <hi>Spiritus Precum.</hi> And it is ſaid of him, that he prays by unſpeakable ſighs. It would ſeem then that this ſo Divine exerciſe ſhould need neither preparation nor rules, and that it had nothing to do, but to expect the Inſpiration of Grace. And yet the Wiſe man adviſes us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that we muſt prepare the Soul before Prayer, for fear of being like thoſe who tempt God; <hi>Ante Orationem praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Animam tuam, &amp; noli eſſe quaſi homo, qui tentat Deum:</hi> Shewing thus, that all thoſe who pray being unprepared, fall into the ſin of tempting God, and that one of the principal cauſes of the Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs in our Prayers, is the little care we have to prepare our ſelves thereunto, by the means preſcribed to us by Scripture, which conſiſts in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing our hearts, and minds from wandring and vain amuſements, that we may find them again when they muſt be preſented to God in Prayer, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the heart doth not run after its Treaſure, and buſie it ſelf with the objects it poſſeſſeth.</p>
               <p n="26">26. 'Tis thus that truth unites what
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:110487:107"/>appears contrary to thoſe who know it but imperfectly. All depends on God, therefore we muſt labour, ſay certain Hereticks, we muſt not labour. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Virtue depends not on Grace, ſay the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> But the Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine conſiſts in uniting theſe Truths, and caſting away the falſe concluſions. We muſt labour ſaith this Doctrine, and yet all depends on God. Labour is an effect of Grace, and the ordinary means to obtain Grace, to think that labour and virtues are not the Gifts of God, is a <hi>Pelagian</hi> preſumption. To ſlight the means God makes uſe of generally to communicate his Grace to Men, is to tempt God in ſubverting the order of his Wiſdom. Thus Piety conſiſts in practiſing theſe means, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that 'tis God who makes us pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe them.</p>
               <p n="27">27. I know well that human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which is dazled by the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didneſs of Divine Truths, and which is puzled with its vain reaſonings, may yet find difficulty in this alliance of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Grace, and in ſuppoſing with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> that what power one may have to do acts of Piety by other Graces, they are never done
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:110487:107"/>effectually, unleſs God determine the will by efficacious Grace. He is eaſily inclined to conclude that we need only continue in repoſe, untill we perceive theſe efficacious motions, which make us practiſe them; that when we ſhall perceive them we ſhall not fail to labour, being that Grace will apply us thereto by a Virtue all powerful, and not having them, it is certain that we ſhall practice them only in an unprofitable manner.</p>
               <p>'Tis an objection which comes eaſily into the minds of thoſe who follow their own reaſoning in theſe matters, which regard the Conduct of God upon Souls. The Fathers who were not ignorant thereof have anſwered thereto in divers ſolid ways, by ſhewing after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it may be truly ſaid, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in mans Power to ſatisfie the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Chriſtian Piety, and that 'tis their fault if they do not accompliſh them.</p>
               <p n="28">28. But as it is not convenient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereunto in a Theological way, it is enough to ſhew that it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Solidity, even according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reaſon, and that the neceſſity we have of efficacious Grace to Practice Chriſtian Virtues, may well ſerve to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:110487:108"/>men, and to keep them in a ſtate of fear and trembling; but that it can never juſtly carry them neither to Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to Trouble, nor diſpair, becauſe we have always by nature it ſelf a means which ſufficeth to keep our minds in quiet, and to baniſh away trouble and inquietude. The reaſon is, that altho to labour according to God, to reſiſt our faults like Chriſtians, to Pray, and to practice good Works by the ſpirit of true Charity, we have need of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious and ſupernatural Grace. It is nevertheleſs certain that each of theſe actions in particular may be done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without Grace, by a motive of Self-love and human Reſpect, and by a fear purely ſervile. Now though there be an infinite difference betwixt Self-love and the love of God, nevertheleſs the motives and the actions which ſpring from theſe two principles ſo different are ſometimes ſo like, and we have ſo little light to penetrate to the bottom of our hearts, that we do not diſtinguiſh with certainty by what Principle we act, and whether through Covetouſneſs or through Charity. We may well ſay with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> That we do not think our ſelves guilty of any thing, but we
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:110487:108"/>ought to joyn with him, that for all that we are not Juſtified, and that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Judge our ſelves, becauſe we do not know our ſelves perfectly.</p>
               <p>We have therefore always a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in us to accompliſh what there is of outward ſhew in theſe exerciſes of a Chriſtian life. And as we are not able to know certainly when we have effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Grace, except it be by a human Principle that we act, likewiſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always know when we act by a Principle of human Intereſt, Grace not being the principle of our Action. We may take Charity for Self-love, and Self-love for Charity, and in this obſcurity Reaſon obliges us to take a reſolution to do always what is Commanded, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God the determination of the Principle which makes us act.</p>
               <p>'Tis not that our endeavour to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſelves is not requiſite, as much as is poſſible from all ſelf-love, and from all Intereſt; but this deſire does not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us that we are exempt. For one may deſire through Self-love to be freed from Self-love; as one may wiſh for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility through Pride. It makes it ſelf an infinite Circle of reflections upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on thoſe actions of the Soul,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:110487:109"/>and there is always in us a certain bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and Root which remains unknown to us our whole life time.</p>
               <p>'Tis the State wherein God wills that men live in this World. We are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to theſe obſourities by his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and his Mercy renders them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to us, when it cauſeth us to make uſe of it to become more humble. And thus it is manifeſt that theſe Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities being unavoidable on the one part, and on the other uſeful, what we have to do, is to reſt in quiet, and to adone in Peace the Goodneſs of God who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains them for our good, and to act nevertheleſs the moſt ſincerely, and the moſt diſintereſſedly that poſſibly we can, which is preſcrib'd us by his Laws, in expecting the Judgment he will lay upon us in the other life in making us know the bottom of our hearts, which we ſhall never know clearly in this.</p>
               <p>The which ſufficeth at leaſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us a human peace, which is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed from the Peace of God, and which is always worth more then trouble which overwhelms the Soul, and reduceth her to Idleneſe and Deſpair.</p>
               <p n="29">29. This reaſon ought to make us: prefer the practice of all the exerciſes
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:110487:109"/>of a Chriſtian life, before a ſoft, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and ſlothful life, becauſe it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that thoſe who do not practice them are in a wrong way, and that few of thoſe who paſs their lives in diſorder will be ſaved, ſeeing that it cannot be, unleſs God Convert them by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Mercy, which is very rare in the order of Grace it ſelf.</p>
               <p>On the contrary thoſe who practice theſe holy exerciſes, are all in ſome ſort in the way of Peace, they are in the company of thoſe who go to Heaven, and have alſo this comfort, That there are very few of thoſe who ſhall practice them a long time, who arrive not at hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; perſeverance in an orderly life being the moſt certain mark of Charity, becauſe Cupidity is Wavering of it ſelf, and continues not long in the perſuance of one and the ſame deſign.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Thus the knowledge of the need and want of efficacious Grace, to act like a Chriſtian, doth indeed never puzle thoſe who hearken to and follow Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; becauſe they always ſee their way. They know they muſt pray to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion, mortify continually their Paſſions, always keep a Guard upon themſelves, ſtrive even to Death for
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:110487:110"/>Victory, never to be tired with practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing good Works, and to be ruled in all things. They know that the incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherein they are, whether it be Grace or Self-love which moves them to act, ought never to hinder them from act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Perform, perform theſe thing,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin, through fear of Puniſhment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. Ser. <hi>13.</hi> de Verb. Ap.</note> 
                  <hi>if ye cannot do them for the love of Juſtice;</hi> that is to ſay for, Charity. They ought then to practice them always: 'Tis what is certain and indubitable, and in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them they ought not to judge that they act only by covetuouſneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſeeing that their hearts are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them, and that they ought not to judge raſhly of themſelves, no more then of others.</p>
               <p n="31">31. In a word we muſt Pray, Labour. and live in quiet even to Death, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning our ſelves to God, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him with the Prophet, <hi>In mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus tuis Sortes meae. My Lot is in thy hands,</hi> both for this life and the life to come, for the preſent, and for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Marching in this ſort in the ways of God with a perſevering Fidelity, if we never have abſolutely a certainty that the holy Ghoſt dwels in us, and that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:110487:110"/>'tis he who cauſeth us to act, we ſhall not forbear nevertheleſs to have thereof a juſt confidence, and this confidence encreaſing more and more according a we ſhall advance in Virtue, will on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> leave us ſo much fear as is neceſſary to reſiſt the Tentation of Preſumption and Pride.</p>
               <p n="32">32. There are yet many other ways of tempting God beſides thoſe we have ſet down. For as this ſin conſiſts it withdrawing our ſelves from the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and in obliging us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrary to the ordinary rules of his Prudence, whether in the order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in that of Grace, we may tempt God in as many faſhions as we can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with theſe rules, in hopes that God will act towards us in an extraordinary manner.</p>
               <p>For Example, 'tis tempting God to engage our ſelves in Charges of the Church without meet and convenient Vocation, ſlattering our ſelves with the hopes that God will rectifie our entrance, and will not forbeare to grant us the neceſſary Graces to acquit our ſelves of the Charge which we have raſhly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken. Becauſe the ordinary way to obtain neceſſary Graces for this employ,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:110487:111"/>is to enter thereupon by the dore of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Vocation; and if God repair this fault in ſome in making them enter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as it were anew into the Charge which they have uſurped, 'tis an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary favour which no man can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe himſelf without raſhneſs and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God.</p>
               <p n="33">33. It is the very ſame with all other engagements in the ſeveral conditions of this life. We tempt God when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into them without a reaſonable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, That we have neceſſary diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to acquit our ſelves of te obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are belonging to them. A man who enters into Office tempts God, if he do not perceive in himſelf a force able to reſiſt Injuſtice, according as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Noli quaerer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fleri Judex, niſi valeas perrumpere Iniquitates.</hi> Thoſe who engage themſelves in Mariage tempt God, unleſs they be diſpoſed to ſatisfie the Obligations of that State, and have ſtrength enough to ſuffer all that muſt be born withall therein, and to bear up againſt the temptations which are either from this ſtate in general, or from the particular choice which they make of the party they marry. They who embrace a religious life tempt God, if they have
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:110487:111"/>not fit qualities to perſevere in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Vocation, and to undergo pains and labour. And therefore thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſuch as have not theſe qualities, far from doing them an injury, do them on the contrary the greateſt Charity which could be done them; being they hinder them from contracting an engagement, the confequences whereof could not be proſperous to them. Laſtly, what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe men form to themſelves, what deſign of life men undertake, what State and Conidtion men embrace, they muſt always, according to the Goſpel, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Charges, that is to ſay, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin what ſtrength God hath given them, and what willingneſs, to Judge thereby if they be not too fool hardy in engaging themſelves therein.</p>
               <p n="34">34. If we do but reflect on mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the choice of the employment and ſtate wherein they paſs their lives, we ſhall find that there is not only no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more common then this manner of tempting God, but that 'tis the moſt ordinary Source of Confuſion which Reigns in all States and Conditions. For it is clear that we do not chooſe them through the conſideration of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the proportion they have with
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:110487:112"/>the diſpoſitions which God hath put in in us, but through certain Laws of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion which mens Vanity hath eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World; according to which we believe, that being of ſuch and ſuch a Birth, and that having a certain quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Goods, we cannot but embrace ſuch kind of lives, and that all others are againſt our intereſt. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner there are ſome who think that there is no other way to be taken for them then that of the Sword, or an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Profeſſion: Others are of opinion that they cannot live in the World, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be Magiſtrates. This Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt be Religious, becauſe in the condition ſhe is ſhe cannot be Married. Thus we reduce our ſelves to a ſtraight by theſe Chimerical Laws; and as God follows them not in the diſtribution of of his Talents and Graces, it happens from thence that we ſtrictly forbid, through fancy all employments which God permits us, and are very remiſs in performing thoſe he commands us. We engage our ſelves therein therefore raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and likewiſe continue therein; we tempt God continually by the exerciſe of theſe ill choſen employments, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of getting his favour and aſſiſtance,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:110487:112"/>we get, without intermiſſion, the effects of his wrath, and the loſs of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. One may eaſily imagin what muſt be the conſequences of this Conduct.</p>
               <p n="35">35. We muſt obſerve yet upon this ſubject, that although men in this life be always in a continual want of Grace, they are not nevertheleſs in an equal degree of weakneſs and ſtrength, and that the different meaſure wherewith God diſtributes his Grace to them, makes according to the language of the Fathers and holy Scripture, that we may ſay there are works and employments proportionable to the Grace of certain Souls, but which are not ſo to others. There are ſome who would loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſtriving to imitate certain acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Saints, becauſe they want the power and force to undergo them like theſe Saints. It is requiſite then that each know what he has received from God, and if he is not able to judge thereof by himſelf, let him judge thereof at leaſt by the light of underſtanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Otherwiſe in advancing himſelf beyond the gifts God hath given him, he tempts him, and is in danger of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting many great faults by thoſe raſh advances.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:110487:113"/>
               <p n="36">36. God having been willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn men together by theſe reciprocal endeavours or Duties of Charity, to render them dependant one of another, as well in reſpect of a ſpiritual as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral life, and communicating to them for that purpoſe more ordinarily the light they have need of for their Guide, by the means of Paſtors and Spiritual perſons, which they may conſult as well as by himſelf, from thence it follows that 'tis alſo to tempt God in ſome ſort not to ſubmit to the order, in refuſing any ones Counſel, and following only in the conduct of their life, their own proper thoughts and reaſons; becauſe this is to oblige God to communicate his light to us in an extraordinary manner.</p>
               <p n="37">37. It may be ſaid alſo, that every mortal ſin which we commit in hopes to be abſolved thereof by Pennance, is one way of Tempting God. For the Ordinary way of Salvation, whether for thoſe who as yet have not loſt the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Baptiſm, or for thoſe who have repaired it by Penance, is to conſerve the Grace they have received, and to labour to augment and encreaſe it every day by the exerciſe of Chriſtian Vertues.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:110487:113"/>To pretend then that God will make us reenter into the way of Salvation, although we loſt it by grievous crimes, is to withdraw our ſelves from his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Conduct, and to force him to do, in the order of his Grace, Miracles in our behalf.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Laſtly, even juſt men, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons living orderly tempt God in many ways, and often when they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of it. For the Goſpel tells us that the means to obtain grace requiſite for us, whether to acquit our ſelves of our Obligations, or to enter ſafely into the leaſt engagements, and form the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to conſult God upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to pray to him continually; every time they neglect to practice this means, and engage themſelves in ſmall and trivial enterpriſes, in viſits, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, in works of Piety, without applying themſelves to God, without looking towards him, without adviſing with him, without praying to him, in ſome ſort it may be ſaid, that they Tempt God. And as all the faults which we commit in our life time hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens through a neglect of practicing the means to avoid them, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that men ſin not, but becauſe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:110487:114"/>they Tempt God, and thus this ſin which they think on ſo rarely, and which they dream ſo little of, is the cauſe of all Juſt mens fallings, and the loſs of all thoſe who periſh.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Plays.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath ſcarcely been known but in this Age, that men have undertaken to juſtifie Plays, and to make them paſs as Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations which might be joyn'd with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. Former Ages were more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſincere in good and bad. Thoſe who made profeſſion of Piety, did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by their actions and words, the horror they had for thoſe Profane Sights. Thoſe who were poſſeſſed with paſſion for a Theater, acknowledged at leaſt, that they did not follow in that the Rules of Chriſtian Religion. But in this Age there are found thoſe who
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:110487:115"/>have pretended in this point to be able to conjoyn Piety, and the Spirit of the World together. They are not content to follow vice, they will have it honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that it be not withered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed by the ſhamefull name of Vice, which always troubles a little the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which they take therein, by the horror which accompanies it. They have therefore endeavoured to act in ſome ſort, that Conſcience might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with paſſion, and not to come and trouble it by its importunate Remorſes. And this is it they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo much pains about, upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Plays. For as there is hardly any Recreation more agreeable to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly People than that, ſo it was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant for them to aſſure themſelves thereby of a ſweet and quiet enjoying of it, to the end that nothing ſhould be wanting to complear their ſatisfaction. The means which thoſe undertook who were the cunningeſt, was to form to themſelves a certain Metaphyſical Idea of Comedies, and to purifie this Idea from all kind of ſin. Plays, ſay they, are a repreſentation of Actions and Words, as it were preſent. What harm therein I pray? And after having juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:110487:115"/>in this ſort the general Idea of Plays; they think that they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that there is no ſin in them, and in concluſion they go to them without any ſcruple. But the way to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this Illuſion, is to conſider on the contrary, Plays not in a Chimerical Speculation, but in the common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary practice, whereof we are witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. We muſt take notice what is the life of Actors and Players, what is the ſubſtance and end of Plays, what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects they generally produce in the minds of thoſe who repreſent them, or who ſee them acted or repreſented; what impreſſions they leave in them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to examin if all that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny relation to the Life, Sentiments, and the Duties of a true Chriſtian. This is it that's deſign'd to be done in this Treatiſe. But as the generality of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons men make uſe of, tend naturally to the reading of Romances, they may be eaſily comprehended therein, and thoſe who read this are intreated to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them therein, when they are not expreſly mention'd in this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis impoſſible to conſider the Trade of Players and Actors, and to compare them with Chriſtian Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:110487:116"/>but we muſt acknowledge that there is nothing more unworthy a Child of God, and Member of Jeſus Chriſt than this ſort of Employment. We do not ſpeak only of the groſs abuſes, and the diſſolute manner Women appear upon the ſtage, becauſe the upholders of Plays, ſeparate always theſe ſort of diſorders by imagination, altho never effectively. We ſpeak only of what is entirely and abſolutely inſeperable. 'Tis a recreation which tends to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of others, where Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men repreſent paſſions of hatred and choler, ambition, revenge, and chiefly of Love. They muſt expreſs them the moſt naturally and the livelieſt, that poſſibly they can, and they cannot do it unleſs they ſtir up in ſome ſort theſe paſſions in themſelves, and that they be imprinted in their Souls, that they may expreſs them outwardly by actions and words. Thoſe then who expreſs a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Love, muſt be touched in ſome manner with that paſſion whilſt they act it, and they cannot think that this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which they have excited ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, can be forgotten ſuddenly, and that it ſhould not leave in them a great inclination for this ſame Paſſion, which
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:110487:116"/>they were willing to reſent. Thus Plays are by their nature the Schools and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of vice, being that they excite in us neceſſarily vitious Paſſions. What if we conſider that the whole life of Players is employed in this exerciſe; that they paſs it abſolutely to learn in particular, or to repeat amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to act before the Spectators the image of ſome vice; that they have nothing almoſt in their minds but theſe follies: It will be eaſie to ſee that 'tis impoſſible to accord this Trade or Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Purity of our Religion. And thus it muſt be allowed to be an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy profane, and unbecoming a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; that thoſe who follow it are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to leave it, as all the Councels do command: and that conſequently 'tis not permitted to others to contribute to entertain them in a profeſſion contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Chriſtianity, nor to authoriſe it by their Preſence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As the paſſion of Love is the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt impreſſion which ſin hath made upon our Souls, which appers clearly enough by the horrible diſorders it produceth in the World, ſo there is nothing more dangerous than to excite it to nouriſh it, and to deſtroy what reſtrains and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:110487:117"/>ſtops its courſe. Now that which helps moſt thereto is a certain horror, which cuſtom and good Education imprints therein; and nothing leſſens this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour more than Plays, becauſe this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion appears there with honour, and in a manner, which inſtead of rendring it horrible, is capable on the contrary to cauſe it to beloved. It appears there without ſhame or infamy. There they boaſt of being touched with it. Thus the Mind is inſnared by little and little. They learn how to ſuffer it, and how to ſpeak of it; and the Soul afterwards is eaſily caught with it in following the propenſity of Nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis needleſs to ſay in juſtification of Plays and Romances, that therein is only repreſented lawfull Paſſions, and which have marriage as the end they aim at. For tho Marriage may make good uſe of Concupiſcence, 'tis nevertheleſs in it ſelf always ill, and it is not lawfull to excite it, neither in our ſelves nor in others. We ought always to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as the ſhamefull effect of ſin, as a ſource of poiſon able to infect us every moment, if God ſtop not the bad cauſes of it. Thus from ſome apparent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, wherewith Plays and Romances

               <p n="5">5. Marriage checks Concupiſcence, but makes it not orderly. It reſtrains always ſomething of diſorder which is proper to it, and it is not but by force that it keeps it ſelf within the limits which Reaſon preſcribes it. Now exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this paſſion by Plays, we do not imprint at the ſame time the love of that which governs it. The Beholders receive only the impreſſion of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and little or none of the moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. The Author ſtops where he pleaſes this Paſſion repreſented by a Stroke of his Pen; but he doth not ſtop it ſo in thoſe in whom he excites it. The repreſentation of a legitimate Love, and of that which is not ſo, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes almoſt the ſame effect, and excites only the ſame motion which acts after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards differently, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſpoſitions which it meets with; and often alſo the Repreſentation of a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:110487:118"/>private paſſion, with this vail of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is moſt dangerous, becauſe the Mind looks upon it with leſs precaution, as it is received there with leſs horror, and becauſe the Heart is carried thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with leſs reſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That which renders Plays more dangerous, is becauſe they diſperſe all the remedies, which are able to hinder the bad impreſſion they make. The Heart is ſoften<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d by the pleaſure of them. The Mind thereby is altogether buſied with outward objects, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely beſotted with the follies which are there repreſented, and conſequently not in a condition of Chriſtian vigilance, neceſſary to reſiſt temptations, and like a Reed bent by all ſorts of winds. There is great likelihood that no body hath ever thought of preparing themſelves againſt them by Prayer, ſeeing that the Spirit of God would much rather incline to avoid this dangerous ſort of Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, than to beſech his Grace to be preſerved from the corruption, which there it met withall. If then Perſons who live in ſolitude, and in retirement from the World, do yet find great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in a Chriſtian Life, even in Monaſteries. If they receive tryals
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:110487:118"/>of wordly Commerce at the ſame time, when 'tis Charity and neceſſity that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages them therein, and that they keep themſelves upon their gards as much as they can, that they may reſiſt: What may be the wounds, and downfall of thoſe who leading a life abſolutely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, expoſe themſelves to temptations, which the ſtrongeſt are not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo? Ought it not to be ſaid of them, comparing them with holy perſons, what <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of man, comparing him with the Angels. <hi>Ecce qui ſerviunt ei non ſunt ſtabiles, &amp; in Angelis ſuis reperit pravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; quanto magis qui habitant domos lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teas conſumentur a Tinea?</hi> If theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which ſerve God as Miniſters are not ſtable, and if he find fault in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves, by how much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will Souls encloſed in Bodies, as in houſes of clay, be ſubject to corruption and ſin? Or what <hi>Eſaias</hi> ſaid, <hi>Super hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum populi mei Spinae &amp; vepres aſcende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt; quanto magis ſuper omnem Domum gandii Civitatis exultantis?</hi> If the ground of my people, ſaith our Lord, is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Briars and Thorns, that is, if the Souls which ſigh after their Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Country, are ſometimes peirced by the Stings of Sin, what diſorders will not

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. We ought to conſider that Plays are tentations taught with gayety, which ſeperates and takes away Gods grace from us, and inclines him more to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake and abandon us to our own proper corruption, then thoſe whereinto we fall unawares. It is raſhneſs, Pride, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety to think that we are capable to reſiſt, without Grace, the tentations we meet with in plays; and it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and a folly to believe that God will always deliver us from danger by his Grace, when we expoſe our ſelves voluntarily, and without neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We deceive our ſelves mightily in thinking that Plays make no ill Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon us, becauſe we perceive not that they excite in us any ill deſires. There are many ſteps before we come to an entire corruption of mind and heart; and 'tis always much harm to the Soul to deſtroy the Rampiers which ſave it from tentations. 'Tis to wrong her much to accuſtome her to behold theſe ſorts of Objects without dread, and with
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:110487:119"/>a kind of Complacency, and to poſſeſs her that 'tis a pleaſure to love and to be loved. The averſion which ſhe had for them ſerved her as Fortreſſes which ſtopt the paſſage to the Divel, and when they are ruined by Plays, he enters afterwards eaſily. There is often a long time that we begin to fall before we chance to be aware of it. The misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the Soul are long and tedious; they have preparations and Progreſſes, and it happens often that we lye under theſe temptations, only becauſe we have weakned our ſelves in occaſions of ſmall importance.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Let thoſe then (who perceive not that Plays and Romances excite in their minds theſe Paſſions which are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily apprehended) not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for all that, ſafe, and let them Imagine that theſe Lectures and theſe Sights have done them no harm. The Word of God which is the Seed of life, and the word of the Devil which is the Seed of death have this common, That they remain often a long time hidden in the heart without producing any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effect. God oftentimes joyns the Salvation of certain perſons to words of Truth which he hath ſown in their
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:110487:120"/>Soul twenty years before, and which he awakens when he pleaſeth, to make them produce the fruits of life. And the devil contents himſelf likewiſe ſometimes to repleniſh the memory with theſe Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, without going further, or forming yet any ſenſible temptation. But at length, after a long time he enlivens them, even without our ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring how they are crept in, to the end that they may produce the fruits of Death, <hi>ut fructificent Morti,</hi> which is the only mark he propoſeth in all that he hath done in reſpect of men. We may ſay then to thoſe, who boaſt that Plays and Romances provoke not in them the leaſt evil thought, that they expect a little, that the Devil will know when to take his time, and will be ſure to find a favourable occaſion. Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly engaging them to him by other tyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he neglects none to make uſe of thoſe which are moſt viſible; but if he hath need of them to deſtroy them, he will not be wanting to employ them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If it ſhould be true, that Playes could produce no bad effects upon the minds of certain perſons, they ſhould not therefore take them for innocent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, nor believe that they are not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:110487:120"/>guilty in aſſiſting at them. A Play is not acted for one ſingle perſon. 'Tis a ſhew which is expoſed to all ſorts of humors, the moſt part whereof are weak and feeble, and to whom conſequently it is very dangerous. 'Tis their fault, will you ſay, to be preſent in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; It is true, but 'tis your fault likewiſe, ſeeing that you make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the making them look upon Plays as an indifferent thing. The more you are orderly in your other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the more they are bold to imitate you in that. Why, ſay they, Shall we ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple going to Plays, ſeeing that virtuous people go thereunto? You participate then of their Sin; and if Plays hurt you not of themſelves, you are prejudiced by thoſe damages which others receive by your example; and thus you are the moſt blameable of all. Worldly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of whom we take no example, are ſcarcely faulty but by their proper ſins. But thoſe who will paſs for virtuous, and who practiſe indeed ſome good Works, are faulty by their proper ſins, and by thoſe of others; and looſe not only the merit of their good works, but they poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon them in ſome ſort, in making them ſerve to engage others in ſin.</p>

               <p n="11">11. God asketh of men, properly ſpeaking, only their love; but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it abſolutely. He will have no diviſion of it. And as he is their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Good, he Wills that they fix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no where elſe, nor that they ſet their minds upon any creature, becauſe no Creature is their end. The fulneſs of Charity which we ow to God, ſaith <hi>St. Auſtine,</hi> permits not that we let any Current run out. <hi>Nullum rivum duei ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra patitur.</hi> Therefore what goodneſs ſoever can be imagined in the love of a mortal Creature, this Love is always vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and illegitimate, when ſpringing from any other than the love of God; and it cannot ſpring from thence, when 'tis a love of paſſion, and ſelf-intereſt, which makes us find our joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this Creature. A Chriſtian who knows what he ows to God, ought not to ſuffer any alteration in his heart, nor any fixedneſs of this ſort without condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; without being ſorry for it; and without beſeeching God to be delivered from it, and he ought to have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream horror that he himſelf ſhould be the object of this paſſion, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in any others, and thus in ſome ſort their Idol; ſeeing that Love
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:110487:121"/>is a worſhip which is only due to God, as God can be only honoured by Love. <hi>Nec colitur niſi amando.</hi> 'Tis this which ſhews that there is a great number of Women, who believing themſelves inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, as having indeed ſome horror of groſs vices, are yet nevertheleſs crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal before God, becauſe they are very glad to hold in mens hearts a place which belongs only to God. Theſe Women take pleaſure in being the object of their paſſion: They are glad that people fix themſelves to them, that they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with ſentiments, not only of eſteem, but of kindneſs, and they ſuffer without trouble, that they witneſs it to them by this prophane Language, which is called cajolling. Therefore what care ſoever we may take to ſeparate Playes and Romances from theſe images of ſhameful diſorders, we ſhall never take away the danger, becauſe we ſee always therein a lively repreſentation of this paſſionate tye of Men towards Women, which cannot be innocent, and which will never be hindred ſo long as Women are delighted with the pleaſure of being loved and adored by Men, which is no leſs dangerous, nor leſs contagious for them, than the Images of diſorder,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:110487:122"/>which are both viſible ard criminal.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Plays and Romances do not only ſtir up the paſſions, but they teach alſo the language of Paſſions; that is to ſay, the art of expreſſing it, and making it appear agreeable and ingenious, which is no ſmall evil. There are many who ſtuff them with bad deſigns, becauſe they want addreſs to explicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And it often happens, that ſome perſons without being touched with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and deſiring ſimply to ſhew their wit, find themſelves afterward inſenſibly ingaged in paſſions, which they only counterfeited at the beginning,</p>
               <p n="13">13. The pleaſure of Plays is a hurtful Pleaſure, becauſe ordinarily it comes from a corrupt bottom, which is ſtirr'd up in us, by things we ſee therein. And to be convinced thereof, we need but conſider, that when we have a great hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror for an action we take no pleaſure in ſeeing it repreſented, and 'tis that which obliges Poets to hide from the ſight of the beholders, all that may cauſe this horror in them. When we feel not the ſame averſion for fooliſh Loves, and other diſorders repreſented in Plays, and that we take delight in beholding them. 'Tis a Token that we hate them
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:110487:122"/>not, and that they excite in us, I know not what inclinations to vice, which ſpring from the corruption of the heart: If we had the Idea of Vice in its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deformity, we ſhould not be able to ſuffer the Image of it; therefore one of the greateſt Poets of this age obſerves, that one of his beſt pieces hath not pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Stage; becauſe it ſtruck the minds of the ſpectator with the horrible Idea of a proſtitution, whereunto a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Woman had been condemned. But what he drew from thence to juſtify his Play, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Theater is now ſo thaſt, that men cannot ſuffer diſhoneſt objects, is what manifeſtly condemn'd it. for we may learn by this example, that men approve in ſome manner all that is ſuffered, and all that men ſee with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the Theatre, ſeeing that they cannot ſuffer what men have a horror for. And conſequently, there being ſo many corruptions, and vicious paſſions in Plays, the moſt innocent, 'tis obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that men hate not theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders when they take delight to ſee them acted.</p>
               <p n="14">14. 'Tis yet a great abuſe, and which deceives very many, to conſider no other bad effects in theſe repreſentations, but
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:110487:123"/>that of giving contrary thoughts to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and believing thus, that they hurt us not when they do it not in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; as if there were no other vices but that one; and that we were not ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them. Nevertheleſs, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Plays made by thoſe who have been the moſt affected to this honeſty, we ſhall find they have only forborn to repreſent ſome objects which are entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſhoneſt, to paint others as criminal, and which are not leſs infective. All their Works are nothing but lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of paſſions of Pride, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, of Jealouſie, and Vengeance, and chiefly of this Romantick virtue, which is indeed, nothing but a furious love or ones ſelf. The more it colours theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the Image of greatneſs and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, the more it renders them dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and capable of re-entring the beſt Souls, and the imitation of theſe paſſions does not pleaſe us; but becauſe the bottom of our corruption doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite at the ſame time, a motion alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like, which transforms us in ſome manner, and makes us embrace the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which is repreſented to us.</p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:110487:123"/>
               <p n="15">15. It is ſo true, that Plays are almoſt always a repreſentation of vicious paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the moſt part of Chriſtian vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are incapable of appearing upon the Stage. Silence, Patience, Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Wiſdom, Poverty, Repentance are no Virtues, the repreſentation of which can divert the Spectators; and above all, we never hear Humility ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, nor the bearing of Injuries. It woul be ſtrange to ſee a modeſt and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Religious perſon repreſented. There muſt be ſomething of great and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd according to men, or at leaſt ſomething of lively and animated, which is not met withal in Chriſtian Gravity and Wiſdom, and therefore thoſe who have been deſirous to introduce Holy Men and Women upon the Stage, have been forced to make them appear proud, and to make them utter diſcourſes more proper for the antient Roman Heroes, than for Saints and Martyrs. Their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion upon the Stage, ought alſo to be always a little extraordinary.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Common Affections are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to give the pleaſure which is ſought for in Plays; and there would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more cold than Chriſtian Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age freed from paſſion on every ſide.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:110487:124"/>There muſt always be ſome tranſport, that jealouſie may enter; that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Parents may be found contrary, and that Intrigues may be made uſe of, to make their deſigns Proper. Thus the way is laid open to thoſe who ſhall be poſſeſſed with the ſame paſſion, that they may make uſe of the ſame means, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the ſame end.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The drift of Plays engage Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets to repreſent nothing but vicious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Becauſe the end they propoſe to themſelves is to pleaſe the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which they cannot do, but by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the mouths of the Actors, words and ſentiments conform to thoſe whom they make to ſpeak, or to whom they ſpeak. Now they hardly repreſent any but wicked perſons, and they ſpeak only before worldly people, whoſe hearts and minds are vitiated by diſordered Paſſions, and wicked Maxims.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Worldly people the ordinary ſpectators of Plays have three principle inclinations They are full of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, full of Pride, and full of eſteem for human Generoſity, which is nothing but a diſguiſed Pride. Thus Poets, to pleaſe them by adapting themſelves to theſe inclinations, are obliged to act in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:110487:124"/>ſuch ſort, that their works may roul always upon theſe three paſſions, and fill them alſo with love, ſentiments of Pride, and Maxims of human Honour. 'Tis this which cauſes that nothing is more pernicious then poetick and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Morality; becauſe 'tis nothing but a Collection of falſe opinions, which ſpring from theſe three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>untains, and which are only agreeable, as flattering the depraved inclinations of the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Spectators.</p>
               <p>'Tis by the ſame corruptneſs of mind that men, without trouble, hear horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinions of a perſon who would fight a Duel with his friend, becauſe the world believed he was the Author of a buſineſs, whereof he thought he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Men liſten with delight to the words of a Father to his Son, to whom he gave charge to revenge him.</p>
               <p>And yet, conſidering theſe ſentiments according to reaſon, there is nothing more deteſtable. But men think that 'tis permitted to Poets to propoſe the moſt damnable Maxims, provided they be conformable to the Character of their Perſonages.</p>
               <p n="19">19. 'Tis not imaginable that theſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:110487:125"/>wicked Maxims which plays are ſtuffed with ſhould do no hurt, becauſe men go not to them to inſtruct their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but to divert themſelves: For they do not ceaſe to engraft their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions without mens being aware of them, and a Gentleman will perceive an affront more lively, and will be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily inclin'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>The reaſon whereof is, that Paſſions excite him, not only by objects, but alſo by falſe opinions wherewith the mind is prepoſſeſſed. The opinion that Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Honour is ſo great a Good that it muſt be maintained with the loſs of life it ſelf, is that which hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for ſo long time, the bruitiſh rage of the Gentry of many parts. If we never ſpoke of thoſe who fight Duels, but as mad and ridiculous people, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are, if we never repreſented this Fantome of Honour, which they make their Idol, but as a Chimera and Folly; if we had a care never to form Images of Revenge, but as baſe actions,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:110487:125"/>and full of Cowardiſe, the motives which the Perſon offended would feel, would be infinitely more dull. But that which renders them more lively, is the falſe Impreſſion that there is of Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe to ſuffer an Injury. Now it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied but Plays which are ſtuffed with theſe bad Maxims, contribute much to fortifie this Impreſſion, becauſe the mind being tranſported with them, and as it were beſides it ſelf, inſtead of checking theſe ſentiments, gives way thereunto without reſiſting, and placeth its pleaſure in feeling the motions they inſpire, which diſpoſes it to produce the ſame or the like upon occaſion.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Yet that which renders the Image of the paſſions, which Plays propoſe to us, more dangerous, is that the Poets, to make them agreeable, are obliged, not only to repreſent them in a very lively manner, but alſo to diveſt them of what looks more horrible, and to paint them out in ſuch a ſort by the nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of their wit, that inſtead of gaining the hatred and the averſion of Beholders, they may on the contrary get their affection. So that a Paſſion which only cauſes horrors, if it were preſented in its natural dreſs, becomes
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:110487:126"/>lovely by the ingenious manner by which it is expreſſed.</p>
               <p>If we diveſt the Image of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Anger of all the Paint the Poet beſtows on it, and that we conſider it by reaſon, we can imagin nothing more deteſtable then the fury of an incenſed perſon, whom a fooliſh Paſſion cauſeth to violate all the Laws of Nature. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs this ſame diſpoſition of mind ſo criminal in it ſelf hath nothing that is horrible, being dreſſed up in theſe Ornaments, and the Spectators are more inclined to love this Fury then to hate it. We have made uſe of theſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on purpoſe, becauſe they are leſs dangerous to be reported. But it is true that the Poets practice this Artifice of diſguiſing Vices into ſubjects much more hurtful then that. And if we conſider almoſt all Plays and all Romances, we ſhall hardly find therein any thing but vicious Paſſions beautified and ſet forth with a certain Paint which makes them agreable to worldly people. Now if it be not permitted to love Vices, may one take delight in things which tend to render them amiable?</p>
               <p n="21">21. A Chriſtian having renounced the World, his Pleaſures, and his Pomps,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:110487:126"/>cannot ſeek after pleaſure as pleaſure, nor divertiſement for divertiſement ſake. He muſt, that he may be able to uſe them without ſinning, act in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that one may ſay truly of him, that he uſeth them with the moderation of one who doth uſe them, and not with the paſſion of one who loves them, <hi>

               <p>'Tis eaſie to conclude from thence, that 'tis not a Chriſtian life, but a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and brutal life, to employ the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of our time in recreation, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that 'tis not permitted for ones ſelf, but only to render the ſoul more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of labour. For if no body doubt but that 'tis a dangerous life for a man that ſhould do nothing but eat, and ſit at Table from morning till night, which the Prophet condemns in theſe words, <hi>Vae vae qui Couſurgitis mane ad ebrietatem ſectandam, &amp; potandum uſque ad veſperam.</hi> 'Tis not hard to ſee that it is not leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing the life which God hath given us to ſerve him, to ſpend it totally in that

               <p>This is ſufficient to condemn the moſt part of thoſe who go to Plays; For it is clear, that they go not thither to eaſe the mind of ſerious occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being that theſe people, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly worldly Women, hardly ever employ or buſy themſelves ſeriouſly. Their Life is nothing but a viciſſitude of divertiſements, which they paſs away in Viſits, in Game, in going to Balls and Masques; in Walking, in Feaſting and in Plays. What if they be vexed, as they often are, 'tis becauſe they have too much divertiſement, and too little ſerious employments? Their vexation is a diſlike of plenty and ſatiety, like to that of thoſe who have eaten too much, and it ought to be cured by abſtinence, and not by the alteration and change of pleaſures. They ought to divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in being buſied, for that lazineſs and idleneſs, are the chief cauſe of their vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>

From hence it follows, that all thoſe who have no need of divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is to ſay, the moſt part of thoſe who go to Plays, cannot do it without ſinning; tho there ſhould be no other reaſon to believe them forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. But it follows not, that thoſe who have truly need to recreate the mind, can go thither without ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Plays cannot paſs for a Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not being able to work the effect, which is allowed to be ſought therein. For a Chriſtian can only ſeek a ſimple refreſhment of mind, which may render him more capacitated to act Chriſtian-like, and according to Chriſtian policy. Now Plays are ſo far from being aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant thereto, that there is nothing makes the Soul worſe diſpoſed, not only to the principal Chriſtian occupations, as Prayer, but to Actions themſelves the moſt common, when one would do them with a Chriſtian mind; that is to ſay, recollected, and attentive to God, which one ought to endeavour, as much as he can to conſerve in the outward actions, Thus as the need we have to eat; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, not that it is permitted us to eat meats ſerving only to weaken the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; likewiſe the need of diverting our
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:110487:128"/>ſelves cannot excuſe thoſe who ſearch after ſuch Divertiſements, as only ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their mind leſs proper to act Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-like.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Playes and Romances render not only the mind ill inclined to all actions of Religion, and Piety, but make it have a diſlike in ſome manner of all ſerious and common actions. As there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing repreſented in them but Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and extraordinary paſſages, and the diſcourſes of thoſe who ſpeak on the Stages, are far enough removed from thoſe which are uſed in common; ſo men take therein inſenſibly an inclination al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Romantick; they are ſtuffed with Princes and Princeſſes; and chiefly the Women taking pleaſure in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which is given to thoſe of their Sex; the Image and practice of which, they ſee in the ſeveral Divertiſements, wherein the young Gallants pay to them what they have learnt in Romances, and treat them like Nymphs and Goddeſſes, imprints in ſuch a manner this ſort of life in the fancy, that the little affairs of their Huſwifery becomes unſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, and when they return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Houſes, with this evaporated Spirit, and quite fill'd with theſe follies,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:110487:128"/>they find all therein diſagreeable; and above all, their Husbands, who being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied about their affairs, are not always in the humour to render them thoſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous complacencies, which are given to Women in Plays and Romances.</p>
               <p n="24">24. The neceſſity which we have to repair the decay of our bodies by nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment cannot ſerve as an excuſe for eating voluntary meats, which might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print a venemous quality, which might cauſe therin intemperance, becauſe this kind of nutriment would be contrary to the end, or intent of eating, which is to conſerve the life of the body. Thus the need we have ſometimes of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves, cannot excuſe them who eſteem Plays a divertiſement; ſeeing that they imprint, as hath already been ſaid, bad qualitys in the mind, that they excite paſſions, and diſorder the Soul.</p>
               <p n="25">25. The neceſſity men have to divert themſelves, is much leſs than they think, and conſiſts more in imagination, or in cuſtom, than in real neceſſity. Thoſe who are buſied in outward labours, need only a ſimple ceſſation from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Thoſe who are employ'd in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs troubleſome to the mind, and not
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:110487:129"/>laborious for the body, have need to withdraw themſelves from the diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſprings naturally from theſe ſorts of employs, and not to diſperſe themſelves yet more by divertiſements which bind the mind ſtrongly. 'Tis an abſurdity to think, that there is need to ſpend three hours at a Play, to ſtuff the mind with foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Men in theſe days have not their minds made otherwiſe, than thoſe in the time of <hi>St. Lewis,</hi> who employed his time well when he baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Plays out of his Kingdom. Thoſe who feel in them this need, ought to conſider it, not as natural inability, but as a vice gotten by cuſtom, which muſt be cured by employing themſelves ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. A man who hath laboured ſore, is ſatisfied when he leaves working, and diverts himſelf in all that doth not buſy him, Plays are only neceſſary for thoſe who divert themſelves always, and who endeavour to remedy the diſlike, which naturally accompanies the continuation of pleaſures. And as this neceſſity comes only from their evil diſpoſition, which they are obliged to correct, it may be ſaid, that 'tis needful for no man, but that 'tis dangerous to all the world.</p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:110487:129"/>
               <p n="26">26. But there is nothing that ſhews the danger of Plays better, and how much they are forbid to Chriſtians, than the oppoſition they have with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal diſpoſitions in which Chriſtians ought to eſtabliſh themſelves, and to which they ought to tend, altho as yet they may be ſeparated through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from their virtue. The Firſt, is continual Prayer, whereof the Apoſtle gives an expreſs Command in theſe words; <hi>Sine Intermiſſione orate. Pray without Intermiſſion;</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt by theſe, <hi>Vigilate &amp; orate ne Intretis in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem. Watch and pray leſt you enter into temptation.</hi> Becauſe temptation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſome ſort continual Prayer, the remedy ought to be ſo likewiſe. 'Tis true, that this continuation and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in Prayer, cannot conſiſt in a perpetual attention of the mind to God, and that 'tis ſufficient that it remain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a ſimple deſire that God know it: but 'tis certain, that this deſire is eaſily extinguiſhed, if care be not had to nouriſh it by actual Prayers, and by meditating upon Divine things.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſtians not being able to lead their whole lives in the act of Prayer, are at leaſt, obliged to renew
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:110487:130"/>it from time to time before God: and as it is by theſe actual Prayers that they entertain that which ought to be always at the bottom of their heart; they ought with great care avoid all that may render theſe Prayers unworthy of being preſented before the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, which not only obliges them to fly diſtractions which happen to them in Prayer, but much more the ſources of diſtractions, which filling the Soul with fooliſh thoughts, renders it inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of applying it ſelf to God.</p>
               <p>This is ſufficient to oblige thoſe who are careful of their Salvation, to fly Plays and Romances, becauſe there is nothing in the world which deſtroys the Soul more, which renders it more incapable of applying it ſelf to God, or which fills it more with vain fancies. They are ſtrange Prayers which are made coming from theſe Sights, or from theſe lectures, having the head filled with all the fooleries which they ſaw there. Man is not able to procure to himſelf the Spirit of Prayer, nor this Holy zeal which excites him when God pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, by meditation: <hi>Et in meditatione mea exardeſcit ignis;</hi> but the leaſt that can be done, is to put no obſtacle by
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:110487:130"/>doing voluntarily, what is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to this Spirit.</p>
               <p n="27">27. God eaſily pardons the diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſpring from the frailty of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but he does not ſo with thoſe which are voluntary in their ſources, ſuch are thoſe which Plays produce; therefore there is reaſon to fear, that all the Prayers of them who go to Plays, being full of theſe kind of diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, are more capable to irritate God, than to appeaſe him, and that they are of the number of thoſe which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks of. <hi>Et oratio ejus fiat in pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum: Let his Prayer be imputed to ſin.</hi> Now if their Prayers which ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite the Spirit of God over all the body of their Works, are themſelves defiled, what ought men to judge of the reſt of their actions? <hi>Si lumen quod in te eſt, tenebrae ſunt, ipſae tenebrae quantae erunt?</hi>

All thoſe Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements which are ſo agreeable to thoſe who love the world, are to them an unſavory meat, which they cannot eat, becauſe they ſee nothing therein but emptineſs, naughtineſs, vanity, and fooliſhneſs, and find therein a want of the ſalt of Truth and Wiſdom; which cauſeth them to ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> that they cannot taſte it. <hi>An poterit Comedi In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſum, quod non eſt ſale Conditum?

All our actions are due to Jeſus Chriſt, not only as to our God, but as to him who hath redeemed us at the price of his deareſt Blood, to oblige us to glorify him in all our works, as <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith. All our actions muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to his Glory, and muſt witneſs, that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:110487:134"/>we will imitate Jeſus Chriſt crucified; that we love what he hath loved, and hate what he hath hated.

Is there any one ſo blind or ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, who can ſuffer without horror, the impiety of this Language? and even thoſe who labour the moſt to juſtify Plays, have they ever dared to offer this action to God?

The Soul cannot conſerve a true Piety, without the aſſiſtance of a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fear, which ſhe conceives at the ſight of dangers, wherewith ſhe is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed. She cannot be ignorant of the power and malice of her enemies, who go round ſeeking how to devour her, as the Scripture ſpeaks. She knows, as <hi>St. Paulinus</hi> ſaith, that all corporal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which draw our Hearts by the means of our Eyes, are ſo many Nets, which the Devil makes uſe of to catch us in; ſo many Swords wherewith he endeavours to run us to the Heart. She knows that ſhe marches in the midſt of her enemies, and of a thouſand ſnares; and that ſhe walks there without Light, or Strength; becauſe ſhe ſees only dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in her underſtanding, only weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in her Will, and rebellion in her Sences. The experience of ſo many Souls which looſe themſelves by their ſight, and the general diſorder which reigns every where, makes her know that there is nothing ſo rare as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian virtue; nothing ſo eaſy as to looſe ones ſelf; nothing ſo difficult as to be ſaved.

For if all temporal things be nothing but Figures and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, in what rank ought Plays to be put, which are only the Shadows of Shadows, ſeeing that they are nothing but the vain Images of temporal things, and oftentimes falſe things alſo?</p>
               <p n="36">36. Sin hath open'd the eyes, to make men ſee with pleaſure the vanities of this world: and Grace in opening the Eyes of the Soul for the things of God, ſhuts them to worldly things, through a blindneſs, much more fortunate than that miſerable ſight which ſin hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured us.

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:110487:137"/>important, than to clear them, ſeeing that indiſcreet reports are the moſt common cauſe of troubles and diviſions, which happen not only in particular Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, but alſo in Societies, and even in whole Kingdoms, and that 'tis difficult that we do not commit many Faults if we be not well inſtructed what ought to be done to avoid them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is ſtrange, is that every man complaining of others upon this point, no man thinks he gives cauſe to others to complain of him. He ſaw enough thereof, who ſaid of others, That they are people who Conſter all things wrong, who report them ſo, who waſt and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the moſt innocent and the moſt harmleſs Diſcourſes, who have neither Fidelity nor Secrecy: But we ſee not therein who attribute theſe faults to themſelves, and who believe they want neither Sincerity nor Honeſty. Finally each would obſerve this Law willingly, that it might be permitted him to tell all that he would of other mens Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and that it might not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed any one to report any thing of his.</p>
               <p>But as all the World pretending to this Priviledge, no man obtains it indeed,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:110487:138"/>it muſt make account that all things will go always almoſt alike, and that the World will always follow its fancies and paſſions, that there will always be found people who will ſuffer themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port what they ſhall thing fit, and thus they need only to be mindful to rule themſelves, that they may obſerve in this point, in reſpect of others, what Honeſty, Charity, and Juſtice demands of us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis almoſt the ſole real Intereſt which we may have therein. For provided that we our ſelves commit not Faults, the indiſcretion and wickedneſs of others can hardly hurt us. They are evil for them, and ſometimes for thoſe who give ear to them and believe them, but not for thoſe whom theſe reports are made of, if they bear them as they ought. God oftentimes makes uſe of them to procure them conſiderable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and thereby to make them proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by the deſigns of his Mercy upon them. Thus we have nothing to do but to ſtand upon our Guard againſt our ſeles, and we ſhall be ſhelter'd from all the reſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are ſo much more obliged thereunto, becauſe unleſs we be very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:110487:138"/>to our ſelves, it is very hard to avoid committing theſe kind of faults, becauſe direction hath no certain and preciſe Rules, and becauſe we cannot eſtabliſh, upon this point, general Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims. It is not true, that we cannot at ſome time report what we have heard. It is not true, that 'tis never permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to tell what may be diſpleaſing to thoſe who have ſpoken it. It is not true, that it may be allowed to relate all that may be gainſaid without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing them. And finally, excepting the Maxim which commands that we relate nothing but Truth, all the reſt are not univerſal Truths, and they muſt be reſtrain'd by divers Conditions to make them Juſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But 'tis not unprofitable never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs to know theſe Rules, and to have them preſent, becauſe it behoves us to ſtick to them, unleſs we clearly ſee that we are in the caſe of exception. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reaſons to obſerve the general Laws of ſecrecy are needleſs, but there muſt be very clear and very preſſing ones to diſpenſe with them. So that when the leaſt doubt is ſtarted we muſt adhere to the Rule, and not to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. This is the firſt Maxim which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:110487:139"/>ought to be printed in the mind upon this Subject; and will ſuffice alſo to mark out to us our Duty in the moſt part of occurrences. For we are hardly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſecreſy, but through a fickleneſs which makes us paſs by all doubts and reaſonable ſcruples, which we perceive formed of our underſtandings.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The general Foundation of the tye which we commonly have to ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in regard of what men ſay to us in the way of diſcourſe is, that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had in conſideration in all his Laws the linking men together, and making them live in a well grounded Society, all that deſtroys this Society ought to be eſteemed as wicked and pernicious. Now it is manifeſt that 'twould be impoſſible that this Society ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, if men were in a continual defiance of one another, if they looked upon one another as Enemies, and if they thought they might not communicate their intentions to whomſoever it were, with ſecurity. 'Tis a Torment the Common people cannot endure, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always upon the reſerve to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may be ill taken. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency cannot abſolutely be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; becauſe minds being different, what
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:110487:139"/>one man thinks good, another oftentimes takes it in the contrary ſenſe. There are elſewhere a thouſand things which have nothing of bad, being ſaid in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and which we cannot nevertheleſs tell again without imprudence and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; ſo that if thoſe to whom we ſpeak, think that they have reaſon to relate all that men tell them, there is almoſt no entertainment from whence we ought not to fear bad effects.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Alſo let us not preſume to ſpeak to people with confidence, but in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them in another diſpoſition, and imagining that they have ſome fidelity and ſecrecy, and as every one may judge what they expect and what they reckon upon that, It may be ſaid that we engage our ſelves therein by giving ear to what others ſay to us that they were promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Secrecy, and thus we are obliged to be upon our guard, not only through conſideration of common profit, but by vertue of this Covenant and this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Promiſe. If we had not a deſign to oblige them thereby, that ſhould be declared, and we ought to act in ſuch ſort that they may have no reaſon to expect it; becauſe it is reaſonable that thoſe who will not obſerve the common
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:110487:140"/>Laws which are received amongſt men, do at leaſt give notice to others of their reſolution, that we may not take them for that which indeed they are not.</p>
               <p n="8">8. 'Tis for this reaſon that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame the Rule and Government obſerved in Monaſteries, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all to the Superior they hear ſaid ill of thoſe who live there. For perſons choſen and tryed may well renounce all the entertainments of Confidence, and the rule which obliges to theſe relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being known by all, each one is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently advertiſed to ſay nothing but what he deſires may be told again: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which thoſe who run the hazard of it ought to complain of themſelves, not of thoſe who do nothing but what ought to be judged they ſhould do. But as the ſame Law is not eſtabliſh'd in the world, and that it would be alſo a fault to eſtabliſh it therein, thoſe who are wanting in what may lawfully be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from them, do undoubtedly wrong Honeſty and Juſtice, and 'tis enough to judge them guilty of infidelity, that they have not ſpoken to them with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but upon conſideration that they would not have abuſed it at all, but would have kept ſecret what could not
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:110487:140"/>be told again without injuring the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who ſaid it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There are ſome who never miſs, when they will that a thing be not told again, to require abſolutely the ſecret. And this is not a bad Cuſtome, becauſe that applies more the imagination of thoſe to whom we ſpeak, and frees them from the trouble of diſtinguiſhing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could or could not relate what was told them, ſeeing that after the expreſs promiſe there is no more to deliberate upon. But moreover as this prevention would be very troubleſome in a long diſcourſe, and that there are ſome who would be aſtoniſhed that they ſhould have ſo little truſt in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, it is likewiſe hard to practice it always, and there ſhould be for that an application which many people are not capable of. It is requiſit then that the natural ſecret ſupply the defect of an expreſs engagement, there being no other difference betwixt natural obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to a ſecret, and that which comes from an expreſs promiſe; only in the laſt we leave it not to him we engage in the freedom of diſtinguiſhing whether he can or cannot relate what was told to him; whereas in the other we remit
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:110487:141"/>it to the diſcretion of him whom we ſpeak to, and imagine that he hath ſo much intereſt as not to tell what he ſhall conclude prejudicial to him from whom he learnt what he knows. But the obligation is alike in the one and in the other; and in one ſenſe it may be ſaid that a truly honeſt man ought to think himſelf ſo much more obliged to ſecrecy, by how leſs cautious he hath been with him, and hath more relied upon his diſcretion, and his fidelity.</p>
               <p n="10">10. 'Tis but conſidering the bottom of the heart to grant the juſtneſs of this Law. For who is he who would not that others ſhould practice it to him? Who is it that would not be glad to find in them this Fidelity, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of thoſe who want it? It follows then by the general rule of natural equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, That each man is obliged to practice this fidelity towards others. There needs not for this expreſs Promiſes and Compacts; The fear of this natural Law is greater then that of all promiſes and Compacts; and it may be ſaid even that this promiſe is found there, and that 'tis that is obſerved by all thoſe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Civilities which are rendred to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World. For if theſe Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:110487:141"/>be ſincere as they ought to be, they ſignifie at leaſt that we are not Enemies to thoſe to whom we pay them, that we have no deſign of harming them, and that we are diſpoſed to practice, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them, the Obligations of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and common Civility. Now the leaſt reſpect we can pay them is not to abuſe, to their prejudice, what they ſhall have told us.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The right of a Pawn hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been ſacred amongſt men, and they have always eſteemed it an Injuſtice to violate it without an exceſs Baſeneſs and Perfidouſneſs. Nevertheleſs it is not needful that he who truſts a buſineſs of concern to another, take aſſurance for his faithfulneſs. He is engaged ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to it in receiving it. Now what is it that man does, in a particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but render him whom he ſpeaks to, depoſitor of his thoughts, which he truſts him withall? Let it be then, that he require expreſly the ſecret, or that he do not, 'tis always the Pawn, which we ought to believe cannot be diſpoſed, but according to the intentions of him who hath truſted it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. There are men enough who think themſelves obliged to this Fidelity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:110487:142"/>their Friends, but there are very few who extend this obligation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons either indifferent, or Enemies. Thus men think they are out of reproach, as to Reports, when they may ſay they have no Obligation to thoſe whom they concern, nor any engagement to adviſe them. But theſe excuſes come only from a baſe <hi>Idea</hi> we have of Charity. A true Chriſtian is not only no mans Enemy becauſe he loves all men, but he loves them all equally, according to St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in wiſhing them all equally happineſs. What though they ſhew more kindneſs to ſome then to others, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the outward effects of Friendſhip being limited, they owe them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to thoſe to whom the Providence of God hath aſſociated with him. 'Tis not then affection that he wants when he ſhews it not outwardly; 'tis this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation. Now from the time that men enter into talk with ſome one by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſcourſe, the Providence applies us to him in giving us the means to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice Charity in its proper place, and by conſequence we are obliged to uſe him like a Friend, which at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Obligation not to abuſe his Confidence.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:110487:142"/>
               <p n="13">13. But muſt we extend the ſecret to thoſe alſo who have violated it firſt by indiſcreet Reports, and who ſhall have abuſed, through Malice and Imprudence, the confidence which we have teſtified to them? Do not they take away the right of requiring from others by this means, what they themſelves have not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? It ſeems at firſt, the firſt ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conducts us thither; but if examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more ſtrictly, we ſhall find that it is rather a motive of indignation, than of Juſtice: becauſe, what would friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be, if each one thought himſelf in the right of making a Magazine of all that ſhould ſlip from his friends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure them, in caſe they happen to fail in their Duties? Alſo <hi>St. Auſtin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves equally amongſt the qualities of aman of worth, never to diſcover what hath been put in truſt to him, and never to do any thing that he fears may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. <hi>Aliena peccata ſibi Commiſſa</hi> Aug. <hi>non produnt, quae prodi timeant, ipſi</hi> Ep. 15. <hi>nullá Committant.</hi> We ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſuffer our Duty to depend upon anothers, nor commit Infidelities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe another does ſo. If a ſlight and unfaithful friend deſerve not that we manage him by his preſent ſtate and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:110487:143"/>condition, he deſerves it by his paſt ſtate. Secrecy is a debt of that time; and as the engagement was not at all conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, it ſubſiſts even when friendſhip ceaſeth: ſo that we ſhould not forbear to continue Debtor to a fickle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant friend, if after having borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Money of us, he chance to break with us.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Now what hath been ſaid of friendſhip, may be ſaid of the tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Confidence, which we take in ſome, in diſcloſing to them things which we would not have known. For this Confidence or Truſt is a ſort of friendſhip, which tho not ſo ſtrong, nor laſting, ought to be regulated yet by the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. We ought to love all men, as we have ſaid already, and this general love becomes friendſhip, being joyned with familiarity. Thus a familiarity of many years, is a friendſhip of many years; and a familiarity of one day, is a friendſhip of one day. So that as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry friendſhip doth oblige Secrecy, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is ſaid in the time of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, friends of one day, or one hour, are obliged to preſerve the ſecret of all things committed to their Truſt, during that day or hour, and the perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:110487:143"/>of the one, can no way excuſe that of the other.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Hitherto I have not pretended to eſtabliſh any thing, but the general rule, which conſiſts in judging of what we ought to keep ſecret, and what we may diſcover by the conſent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of thoſe from whom we had learnt them, as far as this conſent, and approbation is known to us. It is true nevertheleſs, that this rule admits of divers exceptions, but being ſeldom met withal in practice, do no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the uſefulneſs of the rule. 'Tis for example, an indubitable exception to this Law of Secreſie; when any body communicates to us a criminal deſign, which we may hinder by diſcovering it. For we are ſo far from hurting civil Society, in not keeping it ſecret, that we ſhould deſtroy it by keeping it. Crimes are not matter of Truſt, and the commerce of diſcourſe is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to communicate evil deſigns one to another. Thus 'tis he who makes theſe deteſtable overtures, that abuſes this chief tye of Society; and thoſe who tell again theſe wicked diſcourſes, that they may hinder the bad effects of them, make good uſe of the indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:110487:144"/>of thoſe from whom they ſlip.</p>
               <p n="16">16. We ought to ſay the ſame of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Vices, pernicious to human Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and dangerous for certain perſons. For if it happen that men out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence diſcover them to us in diſcourſe, and that afterwards they would engage themſelves in employments, whereof theſe vices render them incapable, thoſe to whom they have diſcovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not wanting to ſecrecy, if they avoid theſe unfortunate engagements by diſcovering what they know of thoſe perſons. I know by the declaration of a man, that he hath bad thoughts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and nevertheleſs I ſee him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to enter into an Eccleſiaſtical State. 'Tis ſo far from being a fault to give notice to thoſe who can hinder him, that it would be a greater not to do it.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Finally one may yet except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance from the Law of Secrecy, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain occaſions wherein men diſcover in diſcourſe; deſigns and pretences, which tho not expreſly wicked, are yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to other pretences, and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which we think <hi>bona fide</hi> more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, and which we are more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to favour; provided that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:110487:144"/>be ſo clear, that he who hath diſcovered himſelf raſhly, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd himſelf of it. For this diſpoſition whereby he may know what we are, ought to ſuffice to adviſe him not to lay himſelf open to us; and his inconſtancy having perſwaded him to do it, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not abſolutely injuſt, that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by his imprudence, to ſuſtain what we take for a greater good. But it is eaſy to ſee, that this caſe is very rare, and that it does not make thus a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable exception from the Law of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Thoſe who have ſome Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or make profeſſion to have any, do not forbear to colour with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of uſefulneſs, the reports they make of others, and think thereby to be exempt from all reproach of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, when they have no engagement at all to ſilence. But to keep themſelves from this Illuſion, they muſt conſider that all profit is not ſufficient to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy theſe Reports. It muſt be great, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that we cannot procure it by any other way. For 'tis a real inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence only to be wanting in the confidence they have had of us. 'Tis a ſource of diſunion, and 'tis to deprive ones ſelf
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:110487:145"/>of the means to ſerve thoſe who injoyn it. 'Tis to baniſh the overture of the Commerce of Diſcourſe. Laſtly, 'tis to injure human Society, by filling it with diſtruſt and ſuſpicions. Thus the wrong ought at the leaſt to be recompenced by ſome certain and conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Whoſoever therefore feels him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thruſt forward to report what he knows not, but by particular diſcourſe, ought to examine all the following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; whether the thing which he is about to do, be very certain, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath not been miſtaken in the Idea he hath conceived thereof; whether it is ſo conſtantly bad, that he hath no reaſon to doubt of it; whether it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant that it be known to avoid ſome great inconveniency; whether this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency may not be avoided by ſome other means. Whether he have practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towards him who is interreſſed all the means preſcribed by the Goſpel to correct him. And if all theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons happening, he be inclined to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it afterwards, it ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely only to thoſe who can give order therein, and not to thoſe to whom theſe reports would only ſerve to ſatisfy their
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:110487:145"/>curioſity, or irritate their malignity.</p>
               <p n="20">20. We ſhall be eaſily convinced of the extream circumſpection that ought to be had in theſe Reports; if we make reflexion on the conſequences, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible indiſcretions which may be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For as ſoon as any report is raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcaped from us, we are no more the maſter of it. It multiplies and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and dilates it ſelf mightily; It ſerves as an inſtrument to the paſſion of ſome, and as a nouriſhment to others, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces oftentimes diſagreements, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and permanent animoſities, which have long and troubleſome conſequences. It engages an infinity of people in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable faults: and all this multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſins ſhall be imputed to thoſe who ſhall have given way thereunto by their indiſcretion.</p>
               <p n="21">21. I have hitherto only conſidered the obligations to any ſecret thing which ſprings from the common intereſt of civil Society and Fidelity, which is a continuation of that tranſitory friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which is contracted with all thoſe who out of confidence ſpeak to us: And thus I have taken their Will for the rule of Reports, which may honeſtly be made from what ſhall have been told us. But
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:110487:146"/>as from hence it would follow, that one might tell again all that they ſhould be glad we ſhould tell; it may be added, that we are often obliged to Secrecy, by the general rule of Charity, which forbids the reporting many things; altho thoſe who have ſaid them, ſhould not think themſelves obliged to it: for we ought not only to have reſpect to their Will, but alſo to their good, and to the good of others. It ought to ſatisfy us, that we know that ſome report may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hurt ſome one to publiſh it. In a word, we muſt regulate our Reports, not by what people deſire in their paſſions, but by what they ought to deſire, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in having a reaſon to ſuppoſe, that when their paſſion ſhall ceaſe, they will be glad that they had managed them ſo: and when this paſſion ſhall not ceaſe, we ought not to make our ſelves the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to do hurt to others, or to our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Thus a man of worth will never fall into this fault, which <hi>St. Auſtin</hi> calls <hi>A horrible Plague,</hi> to report to thoſe who are angry againſt others, the words of animoſity which theſe perſons might have ſaid againſt them; and he will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low without trouble this maxim of that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:110487:146"/>Holy Doctor, That 'tis not enough for a man truly Charitable not to excite or augment, by his reports, the enmities of men, but that he ought alſo to labour with his whole ſtrength to extinguiſh and ſtifle them. <hi>Animo humano parum eſſe debet Inimicitias hominum nec excitare nec augere male loquendo, niſi eas etiam extinguere bene loquendo ſtuduerit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. A man, by following theſe Rules, avoids one part of the faults which he commits in relating indiſcreetly what he only knows by ſome particular Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But that is not the only fault which he is obliged to be careful of upon this Subject; That of believing lightly the faults which others tell us, is of no leſs importance, and it may be ſaid that 'tis yet more dangerous, becauſe we are leſs watchful on that ſide, and we ſuffer our ſelves ſo much more eaſily to fall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, by how much it appears that we have no concern for it. We think that it belongs to him who relates ſomething, to give an Anſwer, and that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon him for the truth of the deed which he relates. In the mean time it is quite otherwiſe: For the Soul of that Man who hearkeneth, remains not without action; ſhe thinketh, judgeth, followeth
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:110487:147"/>her Paſſions, acts alſo often times in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her Paſſions, and if ſhe have not had cauſe to yeild to theſe reports, thoſe Judgments are falſe, thoſe Paſſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and thoſe actions diſorderly.</p>
               <p n="24">24. To comprehend, as to this point, the injuſtice and the averſneſs of moſt mens minds, we need only conſider that when they are Cloathed with certain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, which the Order of this World hath aſſigned to Judges being aſſembled in a certain place, and things are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and treated of in certain Forms or Methods, they act ordinarily after a diſcreet, wiſe, and equitable manner. The diſcourſes of the one Party make no Impreſſions upon their Souls, unleſs they know what the other ſide hath to Anſwer to it. They examine ſcrupulouſly the Proofs; they reject thoſe which are falſe and uncertain; they give leave to weaken the depoſitions of Witneſſes; they ſtop only at thoſe which are not deſtroyed by reaſonable diſproofs, and they never declare a man guilty of a Crime which is imputed to him, unleſs he be abſolutely convicted of it. The ſole defect of Proofs ſufficeth them to abſolve the accuſed, and to condemn the Accuſer; and when they want any of

But when moved to judge of ſome one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular without Power or Authority, they act clear another way. All Proofs ſuffice them, every Authority ſerves their turn, every Witneſs is kindly received; and upon the bare report of Perſons either prejudiced, or ill informed, or waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and without judgment, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, without any ſcruple, people guilty of all that others ſhall have been willing to lay to their Charge.</p>

But if men obſerve not the Garb and the Pomp, they ought at leaſt to obſerve therein what is neceſſary to aſſure themſelves of the truth. Now it is no leſs neceſſary to form the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and underſtanding in particular, to know what each Party ſaith, then to paſs juridical Sentences of it. That which a paſſionate, inconſiderate, and unconſtant Witneſs reports in a Diſcourſe, deſerves no more belief then what he depoſeth before a Judge, and he deſerves even leſs, becauſe the Oaths which the Judges draw from them do much more applie peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:110487:148"/>who have any Conſcience or Honour, to ſay nothing that's falſe. A falſe and uncertain Proof is abſolutely falſe and uncertain. Nevertheleſs thoſe who would make a Conſcience of Judging upon the Bench, on Proofs and Witneſſes of this nature, make none at all oftentimes of Condemning people in particular upon very weak Proofs, and Witneſſes yet leſs received.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Doubtleſs there is nothing more unreaſonable then this unequal dealing; but it hath a very effective cauſe in the Corruption of mens hearts. If they ſhew ſome equity in publick Judgments, 'tis not becauſe they really love Juſtice, they would love it every where, if they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it truly; but on the one part 'tis becauſe the Forms to which they are bound hinders them from going aſide, and that on the other, the faults which they commit in publick would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main abſolutely unpuniſhed, and would at leaſt be revenged by the outcry they would bring upon them, if they were not Chaſtiſed by the ſuperior Judges. There is nothing of that in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which we make in ſecret, upon the reports men make us. There is neither Form to be obſerved, nor Infamy to be
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:110487:148"/>feared. Thus as we have an entire li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to follow the propenſity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we follow it; and this propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty carrys us to receive without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, all that men have related to the diſadvantage of our neighbour; becauſe we naturally love to jeer at others, to ſcorn them, and to ſee them humbled; And on the contrary, we fear the ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the reſervedneſs, and the attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which hath always ſomething of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, and laborious, which makes us rather judge at hap-hazard, than take ſo much pains to judge well.</p>

Who, for example, would not believe the teſtimony of a ſincere man, who ſaith
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:110487:149"/>that he hath learnt ſuch and ſuch a thing, from ſuch an ones proper mouth? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, there happens daily differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces amongſt ſincere perſons, wherein one maintains, that he hath not ſaid what the other affirms he hath heard; without any reaſon of ſuſpecting either the one or the other, of falſhood or knavery. This may happen a thouſand ways, which might eaſily be diſcover'd if we would but give attention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. We correct at every turn, the equivocations which ſlip from our pens, in what we write, for fear they ſhould carry or bear falſe ſenſe in other mens minds, about what is propoſed to them, and the falſe conſequences they may bring with them: and by the help there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we avoid always that what we write be not ill taken and miſconſtrued; and that we be not obliged to long Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

But in the end, the remembrance of what they have added, ſlipping out of their minds, and not diſtinguiſhing what they have heard from what came from them, they attribute in good earneſt to him, who hath entertain'd them with all the words which denote the falſe impreſſion they have conceived, becauſe they find it in their mind, clad with thoſe words.</p>
               <p n="30">30. There are ſome likewiſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the diſcourſes they have had with any one, and not remembring exactly ſome things, make them ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the remembrance which they have left them. But if one asked them then, if they be certain of what they relate, they would ſay no, and that they would not be vouchers. But in the concluſion, they come to quit their doubt, and to be aſſured that they have none in a very pleaſant manner. For in making theſe rehearſals, they imprint them ſtrongly in their memories; and on the contrary, they forget this diſpoſition of diſtruſt, and uncertainty, with which they had made them at firſt; ſo that they think in concluſion, that this remembrance is an effect of the things themſelves, whereas
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:110487:150"/>they came from the frequent repetition they have made of them.</p>
               <p n="31">31. It is therefore juſt, when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe any one for having ſaid ſomething which may fall upon him or ſome other, to inform our ſelves before hand, that is, before we give credit to this report, whether thoſe it concerns be agreed of if, and when we know that they diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, Judgement muſt be ſuſpended, and enquiry made into the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Report, how to determine on one ſide or another. For it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more probable, that he to whom we attribute the thing hath ſaid it, and ſometimes that he hath not. When for example, one buſieth himſelf about a diſcourſe, which notes ſomething of an opinion, if he who diſavows it, declares that not only he never held ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but that he is not, nor never hath been of this ſentiment; his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is infinitely more credible, than the report of thoſe who ſhould pretend to have heard this diſcourſe from him. For a ſentiment is a thing which remains, in regard of which we can ſcarcely be deceived, whereas it is very wrong eaſy to take other mens words in a wrong ſence, and to be perſwaded in this manner, to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:110487:151"/>have heard what he hath never ſaid.</p>
               <p n="32">32. We ſhould never have done, if we ſhould report by piece-meals, all the ways whereby we may be deceived in the intelligence of what is told us. 'Tis ſufficient that we be perſwaded in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that there are many, and that thus, not only in the differences wherein the one affirms he hath not ſaid what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lays to his charge; but alſo in all reports which are made us, which are not abſolutely certain, we muſt hinder the mind from reſolving out of hand, and ſtop the motives, which are the conſequences and marks of belief. By this means we ſhall not participate at all of other mens faults. We ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into their paſſions. If we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſome ſuſpicion of the conduct of thoſe, whom we underſtand have drawn a Picture very diſadvantagious, we ſhall not form an expreſs judgment thereof, wherein the greateſt ill that theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes can do us, conſiſts. Laſtly, we ſhall always be ſo much more diſpoſed to clear them, by how much we ſhall not have reſolved concerning them.</p>
               <p n="33">33. There remains only one paſſage, by which Reports can hurt us. 'Tis when we our ſelves are the cauſe of it; and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:110487:151"/>that people whom we ſhall have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained confidently, attribute to us after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, diſcourſes, either ridiculous or imprudent, which of it ſelf is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate us againſt them, who make or believe theſe Reports. It is much more neceſſary to be prepared to behave our ſelves like Chriſtians in theſe rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, than 'tis to pretend that we can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>alk with, we are often deceived in the quality of their minds, and yet more in the diſpoſition of their hearts. 'Tis likewiſe an effect of goodneſs to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived therein, and not eaſily to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuſpitions of mens fidelity. It is moreover impoſſible to foreſee all the ways, whereby falſe Spirits may abuſe our words, and all the falſe Idea's which they may form by this ſtrange mixture of their imaginations with our thoughts. We ſhould then renounce entirely mens company, if we would not expoſe our ſelves to theſe inconveniences, and as that is neither poſſible nor profitable to all the world, we muſt be content to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them as much as we can, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to bear them with patience, when we are not ſo happy as to avoid them.</p>

If it happens then, that we fall thereinto, however it be, the firſt care and application we ought to have, is to hinder, that other mens faults be not to us an occaſion of doing it on our ſide; and to beware alſo, that in complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they have done us ſome inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, it be not our ſelves who have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it to them. For we know not what is imputed to them, for having ſaid of us, becauſe others have report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Now as they may have altered our words in relating them unto others, we may alſo have altered theirs, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating them to our ſelves.

               <p n="35">35. We owe them the ſame juſtice, and the ſame reſervedneſs when they endeavour to judge of the motives, which they might have had in making theſe Reports. Some are worſe then others, and it is not juſt to attribute without reaſon, the worſt to them. It may be,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:110487:152"/>what our ſpite makes us take for an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of hatred, diſdain, and jealouſie, is nothing but the effect of Inconſtancy, Indiſcretion, Prevention, and of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Conſcience, and of a deſire of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting our ſelves. Let us have a care therefore, that our paſſions go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than our ſight; and let us not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine without reaſon, that we cannot be deceived in earneſt to our diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>

Afterwards we muſt conſider cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe reports and theſe noiſes which incommode us, being careful not to give them more ſubſtance and reality then they have. For oftentimes giving them a Being which they have not, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſubſiſt by our imagination, when they are annihilated in that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we muſt not believe that men who buſie themſelves ſo little with the moſt important Objects, yea and the moſt ſolid, are of an humour to amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any long time at reports noiſed abroad without ground. All theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations have only a tranſitory courſe, and having ſerved for diſcourſe, for ſome days, to idle and lazy perſons, they are diſſipated and vaniſh away when they are weary of ſpeaking and talking of them. We have nothing to do then but let them paſs, and to ſlight them as vain whimſeys, whereof nothing remains. Although they ſhould ſubſiſt for a long time, and that they ſhould make a very durable impreſſion, pitty muſt be had of thoſe who ſhould conſerve it, ſeeing that 'tis to them rather then to us that 'tis hurtful.</p>
               <p n="38">38. But we muſt not only endeavour to preſerve our ſelves from the evil that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:110487:153"/>theſe reports may do us, in ſwaying us to impatience: We muſt attempt to make them effectively uſeful; and they would be ſo doubtleſs, if we knew how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the inſtructions which we might draw from thence, For what is there, for example, that can teach us better the vanity of that which men call repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then the inconſtancy which the Commonalty of the World ſhew upon theſe occaſions? What Proofs ſoever a man hath given of a good judgment, we ſhall not for that be leſs ready to hearken with pleaſure to a ridiculous ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and without ground, which it ſhall pleaſe any one to make of him, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there be found any croſs mind which gives him liberty.</p>
               <p>The World is naturally ſo wicked that it always ſeconds thoſe who will deſtroy anothers reputation, and if it hath ſometimes an eſteem for certain people, 'tis in ſome ſort againſt its will and in ſpight of it; ſo that the World is always glad to be aſſiſted to get rid of this eſteem, as of a thing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodes it.

As it is neceſſary that Worldly Goods be intermixed with bitterneſs, leaſt men ſhould cleave too faſt to them, we ought to be glad alſo that Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation which is none of the leaſt of theſe Goods have its diſguſt; becauſe there is almoſt nothing to which it is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to adhere unto.

All that witholds us then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidge us to a greater ſolitude, and to have Communication with few people, is very advantagious to us.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:110487:155"/>muſt love alſo the Love which we bear him, deſire to increaſe it, and fear the diminution and decay of it.</p>
               <p>'Tis then a neceſſary effect of a true and ſincere Love for our neighbor to make us fear all that may ſlacken this Love. All the Clouds which obſcure never ſo little the luſter of Charity, are hurtful to it. All that hinders it from publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf freely, afflicts it; and it tends always to have a free courſe to its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to diſſipate all the obſtacles which may hinder, ſtop, or trouble them.</p>
               <p>Now there is nothing occaſions this bad effect, more than the diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gious impreſſions we conceive of our neighbors, either upon Reports from others, or from the Idea's we form of them our ſelves. And conſequently there's nothing Charity ought to be more vigilant of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Impreſſions are capable of weakening Charity many ways. What care ſoever we take not to judge at all; theſe Impreſſions nevertheleſs, give us an inclination thereto; for they are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſuſpicions, and ſuſpicions diſpoſe to Judgments: and if theſe Judgments be raſh, they may not only hurt, but even blot out Charity, becauſe raſh Judgment s
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:110487:156"/>may be, according to <hi>St. Thomas.</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſins. Thus, although theſe Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be not yet formed Diſeaſes, we ought nevertheleſs to take them for fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and preſages of a menacing ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They are like the firſt Fits of a dangerous Fever which is like to follow, except it be prevented by remedies, which Chriſtian prudence may furniſh us with.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Impreſſions make us ſuſpect the good it ſelf which we ſee in others, and hinder alſo from partaking of it, both by the joy we ought to be ſenſible of, and by the thanks which it is juſt we ſhould render to God, which is a very great evil. For God diſtributing his Graces to divers members, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Body of his Son, which is the Church, and not giving it all to all, he will nevertheleſs that they become all common to them by Joy and by Thanks, which renders them all partakers of them. No man can ſay, that his proper Graces and Favours are ſufficient without thoſe of others, which made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeps ego ſum omnium timentium te, &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodientium mandata tua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe Impreſſions diſpoſe men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly to take ill ſome words or actions
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:110487:156"/>of themſelves innocent, and wherewith we ſhould not have been troubled, if the mind had not been already prepoſſeſſed with ſome ſuſpicion. One Impreſſion becomes the ſource of another, and what is worſe, we are almoſt never aware of it; becauſe we never aſcend to the firſt foundation, which is a raſhneſs of the firſt impreſſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As they ſtop the courſe of our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards thoſe of whom we harbour theſe diſadvantagious opinions, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten produce the ſame effect in their hearts, becauſe we oftentimes ſuppreſs them not ſo clearly, as that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them not. Our backwardneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in produces the like in them, which God imputes to us, in reſpect of the occaſion we have given thereof. Thus we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly ſeparated from one another, and if there remain yet ſome Charity, 'tis ſo diſguiſed, and hid by the Clouds of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, that it remains without action.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We muſt therefore ſhun theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as much as we can. This is the concluſion whereto Reaſon leads us. But we cannot always; For there are ſome Impreſſions grounded upon ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that 'tis not poſſible to defend our ſelves from them. Likewiſe, we
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:110487:157"/>cannot eſtabliſh for a Rule, not to give ear to Reports, diſadvantagious to our neighbour. For if they be true, and if they be neceſſary, or uſeful, we ought to hearken to them. Now there are ſome of this nature, when Jeſus Chriſt wills that we take two witneſſes of the faults which we deſire to correct in our Brethren, he obliges theſe witneſſes to ſee them, and when he orders to tell them to the Church, he wills the Church to hearken to them. Seeing that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines us to lament for the miſchiefs of the Church, he pretends not that we ſhould ſhut up our eyes, that we may not ſee them; ſeeing that he wills us to judge of falſe Prophets by their Works, he ſuppoſes that we know them. Finally, ſeeing that he obliges us to treat with Men, and to vary our Conduct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different diſpoſitions, he would gladly, without doubt, that we be not dim ſighted, as to what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us thereof, without which, it would be impoſſible, but that we ſhould fall into theſe ſnares men lay for us, which he commands us to avoid in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, <hi>Cavete autem ab hominibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. There is properly then none but falſe and raſh Impreſſions, which we are
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:110487:157"/>obliged to caſt away and deſtroy. It is enough in regard of the true ones, when contrary or againſt our neighbors, that we receive them with trouble, and that God ſee in our hearts, that we ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad they might be falſe; that they ſerve not as a ſuſtenance to our malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but as an object of grief to our Charity, and in a word, if we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in the ſame manner as our own, the continuation and increaſe whereof, we do not at all deſire.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But if this diſpoſition be ſincere, it is abſolutely neceſſary that it make us glad when we have means to expunge this Impreſſion, and that we know that we are deceived. 'Tis by this means that we may judge of the bottom of the heart. Becauſe if men, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, pluck not theſe opinions from us but with pains; if we feel a ſecret ſpight againſt thoſe who diſabuſe us; if we have eyes only to ſee what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours our ſuſpicions, and that we have none for all that diſcover the uncertainty and falſity of them; tis a ſign that we have ſome connection or tye thereunto, and that far from thinking them a burden, which is troubleſome to us, and whereof we would willingly be
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:110487:158"/>delivered, we take a particular pleaſure therein, which ſprings from the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs of the heart.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Charity demands yet more than this. It makes us not only receive wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, all that is able to deface or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh our ſuſpicions, when men offer to undeceive us, but oftentimes obliges us to go even to Truth, and I ſeek of our ſelves the explanations which we are able to find: For it makes us regard theſe explanations as a Good, which deſerves to be ſought after, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from evil, and from tentation; And laſtly, as a debt of Juſtice which we ought to practice; Seeing that we all deſire that others ſhould practice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, this equity of clearing as much as they ſhould be able, the Truth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of continuing in the Impreſſions, and thoſe very diſadvantageous, which men ſhall have given of us.</p>
               <p n="10">10. There is nothing more evident than the Juſtice and the Importance of this Duty. But for all that it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently very ill practiſed. For moſt part of the world are equally eaſie to receive Impreſſions, and neglect to clear themſelves of them. Being more apt to ſuppoſe them true, than to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:110487:158"/>they are ſo or no, Self-Love ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily makes this ſide be taken; and for that there needs nothing but to ſuffer the two main ſprings of mens Rule and Conduct, Idleneſs and Vanity to act: Idleneſs hinders us from the care of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our ſelves exactly of things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is always accompanied with ſome ſort of labour. Vanity fixing us to our opinions, makes us apprehend, being obliged to go from our word, and to acknowledge that we have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant and credulous. 'Tis by this means that the moſt falſe impreſſions become perpetual, and that there are ſo few that ſhake them off. When we cannot conſerve them abſolutely, we conſerve always ſomething of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we deſire to give always ſelf-love that conſolation of not having been deceived without ſome reaſon. Even thoſe, who through a motive of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, forbear judging abſolutely, are more eaſy to continue in ſuſpence, than to free themſelves wholly from it, by an entire explication. For Self-love is not miſtaken in this condition: If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn not people, we think therefore we are diſpenſed from juſtifying them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, maintaining, and approving
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:110487:159"/>their Intereſt. We weaken by this doubt, the praiſes men give them; we obſcure the glory of their Virtue, and we keep them in a low condition, in looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as ſuſpected perſons.</p>
               <p n="11">11. As Charity inſpires us with ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, quite oppoſite to thoſe of Self-love, ſo Charity makes us take a quite different Conduct. And to expreſs in few words, the degrees through which Charity leads us. 1. It cauſeth us, not to receive theſe diſadvantagious impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our neighbour, but by neceſſity and conſtraint, 2. It carries us to keep them in their juſt boundaries, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void taking for certain what is not ſo. 3. Charity makes us always deſire ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, that theſe Impreſſions be taken from us, and favourably to hear thoſe who undertake to do it. 4. Charity enclines us to embrace with joy, all the ways to make Truth evident, and to free it ſelf clearly of thoſe impreſſions which hold its motives by a kind of conſtraint, by keeping nevertheleſs certain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures preſcribed by prudence, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them to thoſe who ſhall have reported theſe things, and not rendring them odious, by diſcovering them to be the Authors of thoſe Reports.</p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:110487:159"/>
               <p n="12">12. There are ſome people who dare not clear themſelves of their ſuſpicion, for fear of ſtartling thoſe of whom they conceived them, in opening themſelves to them. But there is a great deal of appearance that Self-love hath a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhare than Charity in this reſerve. Charity is not ſo fearful, becauſe it ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines not ſo eaſily, that thoſe to whom we declare theſe ſuſpicions are able to hurt it. Charity would think it an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to attribute to them a delicateneſs ſo unjuſt as this. Charity knows how to make theſe explications in a ſimple and humble manner, that 'tis not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble almoſt to hurt it. For ſhe is ſo far from ſhewing any inclination for thoſe ſuſpicions, that ſhe ſhews on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that ſhe deſires nothing more than to forſake them in changing her opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We ſcarcely offend againſt thoſe who deſire to be enlightened with this Spirit. But that which makes one trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at theſe explications, is, that thoſe who do them, witneſs oftentimes more eagerneſs to maintain their opinions, than to inſtruct themſelves whether they be true or not.</p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:110487:160"/>
               <p n="13">13. If we followed theſe Rules and this Conduct, we ſhould ſee the greateſt part of the differences which weaken Charity amongſt perſons profeſſing Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, vaniſh away. For there are very few of them which are not produced, or which are not maintained by theſe Impreſſions, which we do not explain at all. But the worſt is, that every one would that others do them this Juſtice, and yet there are not many that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it themſelves in reſpect of others. Nevertheleſs this common Injuſtice muſt not withold and hinder us from doing to others what Charity preſcribes us, ſeeing that this Injuſtice is evil for them who fall into it, and that Charity is always a Good, and a Spring of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for all thoſe who follow her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Rules.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Behold what we owe to our Neighbour when we have conceived theſe Impreſſions to his diſadvantage. But what ought we to do when others on the contrary are prejudiced againſt us by injurious and unjuſt ſuſpicions? Is it ſufficient to bear them with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to make no paſſionate nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry complaints of them? It would be ſomething to Preſerve and keep our
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:110487:160"/>ſelves in this moderation towards them. But if we Conſult nevertheleſs the rule of Charity, we ſhall find that oftentimes we muſt proceed farther to be ſatisfied exactly therein. Becauſe ſome times we have reaſon to think and conſider theſe Impreſſions as dangerous Diſeaſes for our Neighbour, and to judge at the ſame time, that there are none but we who can remedy it, or at leaſt that we can do it better then any one. Now in theſe two Circumſtances can we doubt that Charity obliges us not to do all that we can to deſtroy in them theſe preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, be it in clearing them as to the Truth, be it in employing other means proper to give them other thoughts of us, or laſtly be it in avoiding all that may fortifie their preoccupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="15">15. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> teacheth theſe Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, and hath practiced them himſelf after an admirable manner. He looks upon theſe ſuſpicions againſt the Honour of his Neighbour of ſo great a concern, that he calls them a Poyſon able to make Souls to periſh. <hi>It is to be wiſhed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that thoſe who have theſe thoughts,</hi>

               <p>The principle of this Doctrine is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in this other Maxim of this holy Doctor, <hi>That, although he who diſdains the Practices of men diſdains alſo their raſh ſuſpicions,</hi>

                  <hi>yet if he be truly an honeſt man, he doth not diſdain their Salvation, becauſe he hath ſo much love for Juſtice, that he loves even his Enemies, and deſires to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, to the end he may have them for Companions of his happineſs.</hi>

               <p>Finally as it is clear that thoſe we ſuſpect unjuſtly are not more undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Charity then thoſe that injure us, we might apply to them what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid of the obligation thoſe, who have ſuffered ſome Injury, have to cure the Soul of what hath cauſed it. <hi>This man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath injured you,</hi>

For having been ſuſpected by <hi>Albina,</hi> an illuſtrious Roman Lady, to have contributed through Intereſt to the Oath <hi>Pinian</hi> made to the People of <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po,</hi> never to go out of their City, and to receive Ordination no where elſe.

               <p n="17">17. This ſame Saint having rebuked ſomething too ſeverely, although with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naming the perſon, the error of a Biſhop who believed that God was Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, and that he might be ſeen with human eyes, and this Biſhop being ſo troubled at it that he refuſed to ſee him, though he offered to beg his Pardon for the offence, ſuſpecting perchance that it was through Artifice that he ſhewed ſo much deſire to appeaſe him. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> inſtead of being ſtruck with this ſuſpicion, endeavoured only to molifie this Biſhop, and to free him from this Impreſſion, and there's nothing more humble then the manner of his doing it.

               <p n="18">18. Behold what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> believed was requiſite to be practiced on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions where there is hopes of Curing other mens ſuſpicions in giving them an account of their Conduct informing them of their true intentions. What if men judge with cauſe that theſe kind of explications would be unuſeful, as it happens often enough; Charity ſhould then apply us to ſeek out other means to deſtroy theſe preventions, not becauſe they are hurtful, but becauſe they may

Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of complaints and reproaches, which ſerve only to exaſperate mens minds, we ſhould try to ſhew them who are prejudiced againſt us, a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſpoſition to that they lay to our Charge. If they think we have no eſteem nor affection for them, we ſhould endeavour to convince them by effective Proofs, that we love them, and that we eſteem them truly. If they imagin that we miſtruſt them, we ought to ſeek dilligently ſome means to give them marks of Truſt: If they ſuſpect us for ſome fault which we are not guilty of, we ſhould labour to take away by little and little this Impreſſion from them, by avoiding what may either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain and augment it, and by dealing with them in ſuch a manner as is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deſtroy it; and by this means we ſhall be ſo far from being hurt by theſe ſuſpicions, that they give us means to correct our ſelves of divers faults, and to enrich our ſelves by the practice of many Vertues.</p>
               <p n="19">19. There would be often times like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no need to diſſipate theſe ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by an application ſo expreſs. It would be ſufficient to diſſemble them,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:110487:163"/>and to continue acting as accuſtomed with thoſe who are addicted to them, without telling them we perceive them. The uniformity of our Conduct and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour would conſume them by little and little; and their minds would find they were changed, even without being aware thereof. But our impatiency ſpoils all; we cannot expect the ſlow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; We would carry the minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by force, that is to ſay, we would make them act againſt their nature.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Although a man have hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his own fault, though he have by the diſorderlineſs of his living, made himſelf ſick, no man pretends to cure him of his wounds and diſeaſes by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him; we muſt have recourſe to the remedies proper for his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and not wonder that they act on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with time. Now we ought not to diſtinguiſh in this caſe the diſeaſes of the Mind from thoſe of the Body. How voluntary ſoever they may be, they are not for all that, leſs durable, nor leſs obſtinate. He knows the nature of mans mind but badly, who thinks, that when it is once prepoſſeſſed, that Self-love hath an intereſt in an opinion, that there is formed an inclination in the heart to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:110487:164"/>judge in a certain manner, we are able to blot out in ſhort time, all theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. It is neceſſary to change this ſentiment, that the mind get new Lights, that it be familiar therein, that it looſe a certain diſtruſt, which the opinions wherewith it is prepoſſeſſed, give it of all that's contrary thereunto; that Self-love accuſtom it ſelf by little and little, to ſuffer the reproach of being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that it forget in ſome ſort, that it had taken another part. All this has need of time, and 'tis ridiculous to pretend, that becauſe ſome ſuſpicions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to us, that we ought out of hand to rid our ſelves of them, and that mens minds ought to act in our conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in an extraordinary manner.</p>

Now if it be true, that the number of theſe happy men be ſmall, and the number of theſe miſerable Creatures great, we have all a great intereſt to inſtruct our ſelves, what it is to be ſcandalized in Jeſus Chriſt; and of the extent of this Word, ſeeing that we would all be of that ſmall number of theſe bleſſed, and not of the great number of the miſerable.</p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:110487:165"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is properly a ſubject of ſcandal to thoſe who know him not, and he is unknown to men only, becauſe he is hidden from them. We ſtumble not againſt a ſtone, but only becauſe we ſee it not; We hurt not our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſus Chriſt, but becauſe we know not what he is. Thus to be ſcandalized at Jeſus Chriſt, is not to know him, and to contemn him through blindneſs and ignorance. That which hides Jeſus Chriſt from us is therefore that which makes Jeſus Chriſt an occaſion of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to us. Now there are many things that hid him from men.</p>
               <p>His Meanneſs, his Poverty, his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and all the marks of his Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity have hid him from the Jews. They could not believe that this <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whom they imagined to themſelves, ought to be environed round about with Pomp and Glory, could be that miſerable man they ſaw amongſt them, and who was not diſtinguiſhed from other men by any exterior Luſter. They could not imagine that man whom they had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, was the Author himſelf of Life, and therefore <hi>St. Paul</hi> calls the Croſs, <hi>The Jews Scandal. Judae is Scandalum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But they are not only the Jews who
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:110487:166"/>are ſcandalized at the weakneſs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. This ſcandal comprehends generally all thoſe who love the World. All thoſe, faith <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> who love what Jeſus Chriſt diſdained, and who hate what he loved, deſpiſe Jeſus Chriſt. For is it not to diſdain his Wiſdom to judge of things quite otherwiſe than he doth, and to chuſe quite contrary to him, to think that a Good, which he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an Evil, and an Evil what he thought a Good? Now to diſdain the wiſdom of Jeſus Chriſt, is to diſdain Jeſus Chriſt, and to be ſcandalized at him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. O how great is this ſcandal, and how common! For how few are there who are exempt? How few who eſteem not men leſs when clad with the Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Jeſus Chriſt, that is to ſay, with his poverty, and who inwardly honor them not more, becauſe they were thoſe of his enemies, which are the pomps of the world, which <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, calls the Devils raggs, <hi>paunos Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli.</hi> What are Princes Courts, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what is the World, but a place where it is a ſhameful thing to imitate <hi>Jeſus Christ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But yet we may not fall into this ſcandal, which is only proper to thoſe
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:110487:166"/>who are poſſeſſed with wordly Love. We may nevertheleſs ſay, that there are few amongſt the juſt themſelves, who parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate perfectly of this happineſs, of not being ſcandalized at Jeſus Chriſt, not only becauſe they have not always ſome inclination for things which Jeſus Chriſt hath diſdain'd; but alſo becauſe they are ſcandalized at him many other ways, which are neceſſary to be conſider'd.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Not to be ſcandalized at Jeſus Chriſt, we ought to know him, and to know him, we ought to underſtand him entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Now Jeſus Chriſt entirely is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Head, but alſo the Members. He lives in them, he is hidden in them. Thus we take another for him when we deſpiſe him in his members wherein he is hid.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is much eaſier to contemn Jeſus Chriſt in his Members then in himſelf, becauſe there he is more hidden. He was not private in the world, but by mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of nature, but he is often private in the faithful by many faults, which Jeſus hath not had, and alſo by many faults, which rob us ſometimes of the ſplendor and the odour of their virtue, and make us ſuſpect that they had nothing in them but human. And as this ſcandal is very dangerous we muſt embrace all ways ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to ſhun it.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:110487:167"/>
               <p n="9">9. One of the principal ways is to comprehend well with what conditions Jeſus Chriſt is hid in the faithful. We muſt know for that, that this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Kingdom, which he came to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh in this world, is an interior King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Regnum Dei intra vos eſt.</hi> He is hid in the bottom of the Soul; where God reſides with the Riches of his Grace without ſhewing often any ſplendor outwardly. A Soul by the poſſeſſion of this Kingdom, becomes the object of Gods pleaſure; ſhe becomes his Throne and Temple. The Angels who know him, diſcover therein all theſe gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs. But men diſcover them only by certain obſcure lights, which make them appear in their actions, and in the conduct of their lives, all the reſt is darkened by the infirmity of the fleſh.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This obſcurity wherewith God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the World the Treaſures of Grace, which he puts into Souls, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth great Good, and great Harm, according to the good or bad uſe is made thereof. 'Tis one of the great means by which God exerciſes in the world his Mercy and Juſtice. It hinders on the one part, that the Juſt exalt not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor looſe themſelves by the ſight
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:110487:167"/>and knowledge of their proper excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and it delivers them on the other part from the tentation which might be cauſed in them, by the eſteem and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of men who ſhould know them. It conſerves them in the way of Faith, in depriving them of the ſight of onething which would draw them from it by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives too human. For if <hi>St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſay,<note place="margin">Aug. de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vir. l. 15. c. 4.</note> that God hath not been willing that the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which Grace produceth in our Souls ſhould extend it ſelf, even to the Body, by conferring immortality to it, leſt the hope we ought to have in him, ſhould be too interreſſed; If this ſame Saint aſcertain, that it is by the ſame reaſon that he permits the juſt to be afflicted in this world, as well as the wicked, for fear we ſhould aim in the ſervices which we render to God, to exempt our ſelves from temporal evils, We may likewiſe ſay, That he permits us not to ſee the excellence of a juſt Souls beauty, and the horrible deformity of a Soul in ſin, leſt it ſhould be through theſe intereſſed motives, that we ſhould deſire juſtice, and have an horror for ſin.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But if this obſcurity produce ſome good in reſpect of ſome, it may be ſaid,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:110487:168"/>that it produces very great evils in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of others, and that 'tis the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe of wicked mens blindeſs. For 'tis that makes worldly people believe, that there is nothing in men worthy of eſteem, but what flatters their ſenſes, and contemn moſt part of honeſt and good men, not ſeeing in them what they love. What is told them of the good of the ſoul, they look upon it as a meer imagination, becauſe they neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nor ſee it. Thus they diſtinguiſh men only by the outward qualities, and by the relation they have to their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as virtuous men participate always of the Spirit of the World, they participate alſo a little of this Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion. The too great tyes they have of outward qualities, take from them the ſentiment of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al miſery of many Souls; and often alſo they have not the eſteem they ought to have of the real Goods others poſſeſſe, becauſe they are covered with outward faults, of which they are too ſenſible. This is one of the moſt ordinary means, whereby Jeſus Chiſt is ſcandalized in his members. For as the Jews would that their <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould be environed with rayes of Glory, we would alſo that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men ſhould have no defect, neither
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:110487:168"/>inwardly nor outwardly, and unleſs they have this agreeableneſs which ſtrikes our ſenſes, we have a propenſity to condemn them, as ſeeing their faults and their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, but not their Riches and their Goods.</p>
               <p n="12">12. This ſcandal increaſes infinitely, when theſe faults which we obſerve in them, are not ſimple natural faults, but faults of manners, and true and abſolute faults. For if we only need to beg of God to preſerve us from the tentation which ſprings from thence; there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that theſe faults which we ſee in thoſe, who paſs for pious men, do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and debaſe them ſo in our ſight, that we deprive our ſelves of the edification, which we might draw from all the other virtues which we obſerve in them. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes theſe virtues are ſuſpected by us; we begin to apprehend that we have been deceived. We know not what to ſtick to, and we enter into a certain deſpair of finding in the world ſolid virtues.</p>
               <p n="13">13. This tentation is at the ſame time very dangerous, and very ordinary. For it is a hard thing to live long with pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people, but we ſhall find in them many faults, not only imaginary, but true and real ones. Human Wit never hides
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:110487:169"/>it ſelf abſolutely. They ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be cheated and beguiled. They are carried away by unjuſt prejudices: they are ſometimes precipitate in their judgments. We ſee ſome who are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their thoughts, others who are curious and delicate in what concerns them nearly: Others who are tender and nice in ſmall inconveniences. There are ſome that their zeal carries to exceſſes. Laſtly, There are almoſt none in whom nature ſhews not her ſelf by many ways. But if men thereupon are inclined to condemn them, they come to condemn all the world, and to paſs from averſion for faults, to averſion for men, according to this ſaying of an antient perſon. <hi>Qui vitia odit, homines odit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. 'Tis good therefore to fortify our ſelves againſt this tentation by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which may be found in Faith. Now Faith furniſhes us with what may be able to diſſipate this tentation, if we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves ſeriouſly to it. For Faith ſhews us that the faults of the juſt are profitable to them in divers manners, as hath already been ſaid, and likewiſe, that oftentimes God permits them more for others than for themſelves. He dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens their ſplendor, that thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:110487:169"/>not to enjoy it, may be deprived of it. He takes from before our eyes, their good examples, to puniſh us for not having profited by them; he holds back the odor of their Piety, becauſe the world hath not received it as it ought.</p>
               <p n="15">15. We are ſcandalized then often at certain faults in juſt men, which are not ſo much for them as for us. They hurt them not, but they hurt us; they are Thorns which are good for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they warrant their Piety from the danger it would be in of being wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mens praiſes; but theſe Thorns wounding us, hinder us from approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and from perceiving the good ſmell of them. And thus there are none but we who looſe thereby.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Juſt mens faults enter into the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Providence, and often God makes uſe of them to execute his greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt the wicked. Poſſibly <hi>St. Chryſiſtome</hi> might have dealt better with <hi>Aroadia</hi> and <hi>Eudoxia;</hi> and that if he had done ſo, they had not abandoned him to the fury of <hi>Theophilus:</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and the wicked Biſhops of that time deſerved to be abandoned to their paſſions, and blinded by a ſucceſs, conform to their deſigns; God did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:110487:170"/>this Saint to follow the heat of his zeal.</p>
               <p n="17">17. There are virtuous men, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the Life of <hi>St. Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> were perſwaded to believe that he might, without violating the Laws of the Church, have yielded to many things, which King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second deſired of him; yet the heart of this Holy Biſhop being right, and the heart of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> corrupted, the proceedings of this Saint being Humble and Juſt, the Kings proceedings violent and unjuſt, God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judged of this difference by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Saints Heart, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of his adverſary, than by the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the cauſe, and did not omit to juſtify him by many miracles, when the whole Church was divided upon his ſcore.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The Cardinal of <hi>Arles</hi> was Author of an enterprize which cauſed great troubles, which was the depoſing of <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. This action was not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the Church. It is no where obſerved that he repented the act; and yet he hath done miracles after his death, God having not laid to his charge what he did through zeal of Juſtice, though in ſome circumſtances which rendred his
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:110487:170"/>action imprudent. <hi>St. Peter</hi> of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, St. Vincent Ferrier, St. Catheriue</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> were in divers and different times of Schiſme, and by conſequence ſome of them for the Anti-Pope; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs this blemiſh hath not hindred their Sanctity.</p>
               <p n="19">19. They who write the Lives of Saints think that 'tis their Duty to ſet forth all their virtues, and to hide all their faults. But I do not know if they ſhould not do as well to take notice of all their faults, as of their virtues, to hinder thereby, that men be not ſcandalized at ſuch as appear in ſome pious men which we know. Whoſoevor for example, ſhall make reflections on the manner how Three Saints, to wit, <hi>St. Epiphanius, St. Jerome,</hi> and <hi>St. Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> acted upon account of <hi>St. John Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> will wonder no more that virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men be ſometimes prevented, and fall ſometimes into exceſs, and they will conceive, that there is very great limitation in this paſſage. <hi>Charitas operit multitudinem peceatorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. We ſee often in Saints ſome faults which God ſees no more there; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we ſee not in our ſelves, thoſe which are truly there. If they commit faults
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:110487:171"/>through ignorance, the heat of their charity purifies them, even without their acknowledging them, and thus they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt no more. If they commit ſome thro weakneſs, or thro ſome paſſion, they humble themſelves, and they riſe again more ſtrong than they were before their fall, and by this means again they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt no more. But the faults of Souls grown cold, altho more inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in appearance, ſubſiſt always in the eyes of God, becauſe they want this fire of Charity to conſume them, and becauſe they are not reſtor'd again ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely.</p>
               <p n="27">27. We muſt diſtinguiſh faults of paſſion from faults of darkneſs, and faults of light; the faults of underſtanding, from faults of the heart: Nor is there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly any but God who can judge of faults which ſpring from ignorance, wherein Cupidity appears not to have any ſhare at all: Nor is it permitted for men to determine of the degree.</p>
               <p n="22">22. All Saints have in their hearts a ſincere diſpoſition to love, and follow every known Truth. But they know not equally all Truths, nether are they equally appropriated to all thoſe they know. God enlightens and touches them
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:110487:171"/>differently, according to the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns he hath upon them, and by giving them an ardent Love for certain Truths, by which he will ſanctify them; he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſometimes that in reſpect of others they remain in ſome kind of obſcurity, or in a want of judgment; which comes not from the corruption of their hearts, but from this, that God applys them to other things. 'Tis this that makes theſe who love theſe Truths, to be oftentimes troubled to ſee them ſo little concerned for them, becauſe they conſider not that they themſelves are in this deprivation of Light and Judgment, in regard of many others, and that the heart of man being limited, and narrow in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is in, as to this life, God doth not exact, that it ſhould love Truth, Truth in all its extent, but only that it be the love of Truth, and not Cupidity, which ſhould be the principal of its actions.</p>
               <p n="23">23. When God leaves the Saints thus in Ignorance, as to many Truths, or diverts and ſtops the occaſions, which might engage them to commit ſome faults thro ignorance, or hides by the purity of their hearts, and by the ardency of their Charity, thoſe which they commit, it happens nevertheleſs
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:110487:172"/>from hence, that we may eaſily make ill uſe of their examples, whether it be in imagining that we ought to follow blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all they have done, or in behaving our ſelves, ſo as to condemn theſe Saints, becauſe of theſe wants of Light. But both the one and the other of theſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals muſt be remedied by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this various diſpenſation which God makes of the knowledge of this Truth. For we ſee by this on the one ſide, that there may remain darkneſs in the Saints, in reſpect of certain points, in which by conſequence they ought not to be taken for guides, and we have reaſon to conclude on the other, that it follows not, that thoſe in whom we perceive the wants of Light, in reſpect of certain Truths, cannot be Saints by the application they have to others.</p>
               <p n="24">24. We may add to this, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance thoſe who hurt in appearance certain Truths thro ignorance, and lack of Light; have before God, more love and zeal for them, than theſe who ſhew a great heat for thoſe ſame Truths. For God hath particularly regard to the bottom of the heart, and when he ſees there a ſincere love for Truth and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:110487:172"/>a diſpoſition to follow them at the coſt of all things, he hath leſs regard to the darkneſs, which hinders this Love to ſpread it over certain particular points. Whereas it happens ſometimes, that this Zeal, ſo apparent for certain Truths, is nothing but the effect of Self-love, and a tye to its proper ſenſe. We maintain Truth, as we ſhould maintain what is falſe, if we had the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to do it; and oftentimes God fees nothing that's ſincere at the bottom of the heart, which leads direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Truth.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Thoſe who by a more exact ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of antiquity, ſhould have acquired knowledge and ſome light, which very Holy perſons ſhould not have had, ſhould yet have occaſion to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by this thought; that thoſe Truths, tho great and important, are not ordinarily thoſe, the practice whereof is moſt frequent, and which are the principal of the common actions which compoſe our lives. Thus as the occaſion of practiſing them are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinary, they become often barren in theſe who know them, and we may eaſily believe, that men love them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:110487:173"/>any real or effective love for them. It is altogether contrary with common Truths, as with thoſe which teach to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with our neighbour, in an edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, to have God preſent in all our actions, and to do nothing but by his Motive, and his Spirit, to mortify all the inordinate exceſſes of Self-love, to lop off all things uſeleſs to this life, to correct the ſenſes in all that we can, to moderate our paſſions, to govern all the motions of Mind and Body, not to complain of little evils, to receive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably thoſe who mind us of ſome defect, not to be tyed to our own Senſe and Light; to be reſerved in our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thoſe Truths which preſcribe theſe actions, are not leſs Truths than the others, whereof we have ſpoken, but they have this advantage, that the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is ordinary, and that we ſcarcely flatter our ſelves with loving them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out we love them truly. Theſe are thoſe which all the Saints have known, and 'tis in practiſing them, and loving them, that they are become Saints. Whereas it happens, that thoſe who are more knowing in theſe Truths leſs frequent, and which ſerve only as Rules
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:110487:173"/>to great Actions, apply themſelves much leſs to theſe common Truths, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual practice is the true ſource of the ſanctification of Souls, and of the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we give to thoſe who are witneſſes of our actions.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Neverthsleſs, it happens ſome times that perſons who appear very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, and very edifying in their common actions, are ſunk down in great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, for having neglected to ſearch the Lights which were neceſſary for them to march therein, or through other ſecret reaſons, which God knows, and that others on the contrary, whoſe Lives indeed were leſs exact, and ſtuft more with ſmall faults, ſhew great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and force in thoſe in thoſe occaſions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and ſhew alſo, that they had at the bottom of the heart, a ſolid and true love for God. And that's it which ought to humble in their turn, thoſe who are more outwardly and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more compoſed, becauſe they know not for all, that what their force is, and that perchance they are with all this outward regularity, weaker and more imperfect before God, than thoſe whoſe imperfections ſtrike more upon
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:110487:174"/>the eyes of the world. So great a care hath God to keep in this life, all things in obſcurity, and uncertainty, to take from us all right of magnifying our ſelves in our ſelves, and contemning others.</p>

Becauſe Sermons in general being neceſſary for the Church, and God having choſen this way for the inſtruction of his people, it is requiſite, that they whoſe Piety ſerves
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:110487:175"/>for a Rule to others, contribute to cauſe this miniſtry to ſubſiſt, in giving the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to render themſelves aſſiduous in publick inſtructions. Otherwiſe if thro a judgment which they might make of the Preachers; they did perſwade the people to diſpenſe with the hearing them, this Miniſtry would by little and little be laid aſide, and the ſimple poor people would find themſelves thereby deprived of the principal means which God hath given them to be inſtructed with the neceſſary Truths for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But that they may not ordain only this action to the edification of others, and that they may profit alſo thereby themſelves, their Piety ought to apply them to find ſome means whereby they may profit by all ſorts of Sermons: and ſeeing that 'tis not in their power to cauſe, that all thoſe who engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to preach, acquit themſelves of this miniſtry as they ought, they ought to labour to acquit themſelves as they ſhould of that duty of hearing Sermons, which is another function, having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe its obligations, and by conſequence its rules.</p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:110487:175"/>
               <p n="3">3. We ſee at firſt, that the ſeeking out of theſe means, and of theſe rules, ought to conſiſt in finding out Holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, whereby to edify our ſelves by bad Sermons. For there needs no method to gain by good ones. Every one knows, that he ought to open his heart to ſolid Truths, which are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him therein; that he ought to beg Grace of God, that they increaſe as Divine Seed; that he ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them in his memory as a precious Treaſure; that he muſt act in ſuch ſort, that weighing them often in his mind, they may take root, and ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there, and that laſtly he muſt ſeek occaſions to reduce them into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We know yet, that we ought not to place in the number of bad Sermons, thoſe, wherein Truths, otherwiſe ſolid and edifying, ſhould be propoſed after a groſs and unpleaſing manner; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Preacher ſhould have but a little Talent, little of outward addreſs, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle facility to expreſs himſelf. For provided, that the Subject be good, it is requiſite that a judicious Auditor fix himſelf thereto, and that he make uſe of it to cover the outward defects.</p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:110487:176"/>
               <p n="5">5. It ought to be the ſame, when that which ſtumbles us in a Preacher, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the litle relation of his thoughts to the matter. For provided, that the Truths be good and profitable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, what imports it, that the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it be ſo juſt? But I would gladly, ſays one, that they had been propoſed to us in another application. Well, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from this application which ſtumbles you, and conſider them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or make you another application of them. 'Tis always to oblige you, to have given you means to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to theſe Truths. They deſerve ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well to be attentively conſidered for themſelves.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But there are Sermons which are defective, even at the botom, and which are only made up of words, which have more of ſound than of ſenſe in them. There are ſome wherein are diſtributed only ſhallow ſpeculations, and unſolid thoughts: which leave the Soul in want and hunger, whereto we can add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the correction of her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and wherein the people compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend as little, as if they were made or preached in an unknown language. There are ſome likewiſe, wherein the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:110487:176"/>diſſemble or weaken the Truth by a criminal cowardiſe or baſeneſs, or alter it through Ignorance or Intereſt.</p>
               <p>As tis impoſſible that thoſe who have a little light, ſhould not acknowledge theſe faults, we ought not to force them that they ſhould diſſemble them to themſelves, but only that they extol not and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify them. On the contrary, it is good that they endeavour to comprize the greatneſs of the exceſſes which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in this point, and that they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before God for ſo unworthy a manner, wherein Truth is handled by men. For this Holy lamentation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to Piety, all that excites it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to them, and contributes to their edification.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In conſidering with this Spirit, the outrages done to Jeſus Chriſt, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of his word, they will find that they are not leſs, than thoſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the diſtributing of his Body; and that it may be ſaid likewiſe, that they are greater, and that thus they ought to be to us a greater cauſe of grief, humiliation, and terror. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho there may be many criminal and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Prieſts, who inſinuate themſelves to the adminiſtration of the Sacraments
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:110487:177"/>and the diſtribution of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; there is nothing more rare then to find of them impious enough to give to the faithful unconſecrated Hoſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Body it ſelf of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or to mingle Poyſon with Conſecrated Hoſts, that thereby they may kill the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of thoſe who receive them.</p>
               <p>Thus altho the wicked Prieſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Sacriledge through the boldneſs they have of inſinuating themſelves into ſo Divine Functions, thoſe nevertheleſs who participate of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by their Miniſtry, receive no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice thereby. 'Tis not the ſame with the Word of God. For there are not only ſome Prieſts who diſhonour it by preſuming to Preach it, when they ought to think of nothing more then doing Penance for their Crimes, and who draw upon themſelves thereby the Reproach which God makes them in theſe words of the Kingly Prophet. <hi>Peccatori autem d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:110487:177"/>of the true word of God, diſtribute only their imaginations, which is not hurtful only to the ignorant in depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them of the nouriſhment they have need of, but deceives them wickedly by ſuffering them to receive, as the Word of God, thoughts altogether human and profane.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We need not only apply theſe conſiderations to the preſent State of the Church to acknowledge that there are a great number of Chriſtians that ſuffer what the Scripture calls <hi>Famam Verbi,</hi> The deſire of God's Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who are charged with this inſtruction, inſtead of ſolid Truths drawn from this word, wherewith they ought to nouriſh them, feed them only with their own proper thoughts and vain ſpeculations; and that thence it is that the Church experiences in many places this terrible Wound wherewith God has at other times threatned to ſtrike the <hi>Jews,</hi> which the ſame Scripture calls <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bera Arentia,</hi> The Breaſts giving no Milk, that is to ſay, Paſtors without light, and incapapable of nouriſhing their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the Doctrine of Truth; which at the ſame time ought to ſtir up in us ſentiments of Compaſſion for the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:110487:178"/>miſery of ſo many Souls, motives of acknowledgment, that God hath treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us more fovourably than them, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us the knowledge of his Truth, which he ſuffers them to be deprived of, and a wholſome fright through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the little uſe we have made of all theſe helps.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If theſe Sermons which pleaſe us ſo little of themſelves, did make us enter into theſe Sentiments, they would alſo become as profitable to us as thoſe which fill our memories the moſt with edifying Truths. There are hardly any of more importance than thoſe which may be learnt by the chaſtiſement which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes upon the Church. For he ſhews that the knowledge of Truth is not due to us, that we deſerve to be deprived of it; that this deprivation is the juſt puniſhment of our diſorders; that we ought to impute to our ſelves this want of Evangelical Preachers; that thus the faults they commit in the exerciſe of their miniſtry, are in ſome ſort ours, ſeeing that 'tis to puniſh us, that God permits them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We muſt not imagine that we have no reaſon to fear, as to our ſelves, the effects of Gods wrath, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:110487:178"/>that we are better inſtructed, and that we have divers ways to ſupply the defects of Preachers. For God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo other ſorts of blindneſſes to ſpread over us, which we ought not to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend leſs. If he puniſh us not by depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us of the knowledge of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Duty in ſome important occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this deprivation is enough to make us enter into ſome unlucky engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to render all our other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges unuſeful. We have not therefore leſs need of his light, nor leſs obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſeek it. And as this Light is communicated in the ordinary way by the Miniſtry of men; no man can ſay, he hath not need of a Preacher, that is, of a man who makes him underſtand what God requires from him.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But there is no need that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the diſorders, which are committed in the diſpenſation of Gods word, as well as in the diſtributing the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, apply us only to the conſideration of his Juſtice towards the wicked; it ought to fill us yet more with the admiration of his bounty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Elect. For 'tis for them that he ſuffers all thoſe prophanations, with an incomprehenſible patience. 'Tis for
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:110487:179"/>them he commands, that his Body reſide even to the end of the world upon our Altars, and that it enter into the mouths of all thoſe who would receive him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having regard to the Sacriledges that ſo many impious people commit in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, to the end, that his choſen may not be deprived of this Divine nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, which is the ordinary means of their Salvation. Hence it happens ſometimes, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt remains whole years in the Churches, in the hands of wicked Prieſts, who diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour it every day by new Impieties, and receives thereby abundance of outrages on the ſcore of diſorderly Chriſtians, to the end, that ſome poor Woman may have the means to partake thereof, or to come and adore it. 'Tis alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not there for thoſe who compaſs this particular Church, becauſe they may be all impious and wicked. It is there for thoſe who ſhall ſpring from them long after. It is alſo in conſideration of his Elect, that he ſuffers that ſome wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men corrupt and prophane his word in declaring it, and that he permits that men preach it to people who draw no profit from it, and who become only more criminal thereby, to the end, that ſome ſimple Souls, who ſhall be there
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:110487:179"/>preſent, may be inſtructed, and edified with it; or at leaſt, that the Miniſtry being conſerved, ſome of the choſen, who perhaps ſhall be many years after, may find in theſe places, inſtructions they may have need of.</p>
               <p>As Piety then ought to make us adore the infinite Charity of Jeſus Chriſt, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon our Altars, and ſuffering for the good of his Elect, all the outrages which he received there, it ought not to incline us leſs to adore this ſame Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which makes him endure the moſt ſcornful manner, wherewith his Truth is Treated, whether in pronouncing or in hearing it. And it is very juſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it would be the heighth of ingratitude, not to expoſe our ſelves for the intereſt of Truth to receive ſome evil uſage on the ſcore of men, ſeeing that God ſuffers every day, that this Truth be expoſed to ſo many diſdains, and to ſo many irreverences for our good.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Nevertheleſs, great care muſt be taken to keep this conſideration of faults committed by thoſe who pronounce the word of God within its juſt limits, leſt it ſhould carry us too far; and that as there appears little Light, little Unction, and often little Judgment in certain
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:110487:180"/>Sermons, it make us not conclude that the Preacher is abſolutely unprovided of all thoſe qualities. For this Judgment may be ill-grounded. There are ſome perſons who preach very ill, and who nevertheleſs have Piety, and alſo Light and Judgment in other things; and the reaſon thereof is, that they preach ill, becauſe they have a falſe Idea, and that they have at firſt propoſed evil models. They apprehend, I know not how, that Sermons ought to have ſomething that's excellent, ſublime, and extraordinary; and that common and popular thoughts are to be avoided therein. Thus when they are to preach, they neither conſult the Heart, nor the diſpoſition of their Auditors; they skip into a certain regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their mind, where moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they inhabit not, and where they have a magazine of falſe thoughts, and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſpeculations, which this falſe Idea wherewith they are pre-occupied makes them approve. But as their Judgment is only ſpoiled in this place, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear not to be judicious in other things, when they leave the Pulpit, where they are in ſome ſort in a violent ſtate and condition, and are returned to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner of ſpeaking and thinking.</p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:110487:180"/>
               <p n="13">13. After we ſhall have practiſed this equity towards the Preacher, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to manage him as well as we ſhall be ble in what ſhall be ſaid before others, for fear of hindring the fruit he might make upon thoſe who ſhould have other Conſiderations, than we. We ſhall be forced to conſider all that he ſays, and endeavour to find therein ſomething which may be able to edify us, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we may fix our minds; and it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard if we proſper not therein, if we do it faithfully; or that we have not at leaſt reaſon to be convinced, that 'tis our lack of Light and Virtue, which hinders us from profiting thereby.</p>
               <p n="14">14. We deſire always that all Sermons ſhould contain ſome brave principle of Morality well expreſſed, and well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, that they may make us obſerve ſome conſiderable defect in the lives of Chriſtians, that they may make us prone to practice ſome important obligation, And indeed it were to be wiſhed that they were ſuch; and 'tis a defect when that is not; becauſe Preachers ought to imagine that the vulgar people are ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly edified without theſe kind of Sermons, which made <hi>St. Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales</hi> ſay, <hi>That he did not find that a Sermon was
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:110487:181"/>good, if the Preacher had not for his Mark the Building ſome Corner of the Walls of</hi> Jeruſalem. Nevertheleſs we ought to acknowledge that 'tis alſo a fault to have ſo ſtrict a Piety. Chriſtian Virtue has a larger extent. It is not always buſied with the correction of our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, nor with the care of inſtructing or teaching Chriſtian Principles. It is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful ſometimes of it ſelf, that it may be raiſed abſolutely to God, to admire him, to Praiſe him, to conſider his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries in themſelves without any refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon it ſelf, to Contemplate the works of his Mercy and Juſtice, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the Graces he hath beſtowed on the Saints. Now there are no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which are not able to ſtir up in us ſome of theſe Motives, if we were diſpoſed thereto, and if our minds were not ſo limited as not to ſearch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of edification but of a certain kind, which makes that oftentimes we find as few to edifie themſelves by certain Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Fathers, as by thoſe we hear now a days.</p>
               <p n="15">15. We flatter our ſelves ordinarily with being of the number of thoſe, whom St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls <hi>non Verborum ſed Rerum avidos,</hi> greedy of Things, but not of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:110487:181"/>Words; and we imagin that 'tis this which diſpleaſes us in Sermons where there are more words then things. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs we may ſay that this diſguſt comes rather from a contrary defect, that is to ſay, for that we are more fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the manners and ways then to the things themſelves, and that we love the rarity, the excellency, and the aptneſs of thoughts, better then their Solidity and Truth. For laſtly there are no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſo bad where there is not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Truth; but they touch us not at all, becauſe they are either common or out of their place, or ill expreſſed, or that they are mingled with falſe thoughts, or they miſs the Subject. So ſeeing all theſe faults joyned to Truth take the reliſh of it abſolutely away, we muſt needs have but little love for it. A Diamond caſt into the dirt, looſes not its luſter nor its price in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of us; we take great care to dig it out when we diſcover it, and often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves thereto ſo much the more as we find it in a place that ſeems to diſhonour it. We ſhould make as much of this Pittance of Chriſtian Truths, which is found in certain Sermons, it would be juſt that we apply our ſelves
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:110487:182"/>thereunto with ſo much more attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that our Spirits might not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted by a great number of things which might deſerve application. Now there is no Chriſtian Truth conſidered as it ought, that is not capable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us, and likewiſe there is not any which will not appear to have a very large extent if we have light enough to penetrate what it includes.</p>
               <p n="16">16. We ought to conſider well that theſe common truths which we hear with diſguſt are infinitely above all that can be found in the Books of Paganiſm, which men read with ſo much eſteem, and ſo much pleaſure; That 'Tis a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Grace that God has done us to have been pleaſed to diſcover them to us, having kept them hid four thouſand years from all men; that the Prophets themſelves and the Saints of the Old Teſtament have ſighed to know them in this excellency with which they are revealed to us; that they make up part of thoſe Judgments which <hi>David</hi> ſpoke of with ſo much ſenſe of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Non fecit taliter omni Nationi, &amp; Judicia ſua non manifeſtavit eis.</hi> And this may ſuffice to give us Confuſion that ſome human defects with which
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:110487:182"/>they are enveroined, may make us looſe entirely the guſt and love for them.</p>
               <p n="17">17. As St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays, That men diſcern Beauty and Juſtice better when they obſerve them in objects, which have nothing but what gives horrour to the Senſes, ſuch as the members of Martyrs were, when covered over with Wounds; may we not ſay alſo that they cannot acknowledge better that they love Truth for it ſelf, then when preſented to us in diſcourſes wherein we can love nothing but it, and where we find alſo an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite of diſpleaſing things. Thus theſe ſorts of Sermons may be made good uſe of to honour Truth for it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dividing the homage which we give to it. And the leaſt Truth honoured in this ſort would be able to edifie us more then the moſt touching inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which pleaſe the mind better.</p>
               <p n="18">18. There are almoſt no Sermons ſo bad, whereby a man may not be edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if what be ſaid therein be new, and that we know nothing what it contains by means of any other way. There is not, for Example, any Diſcourſe ſo cold either of Paradice or Hell, but makes great Impreſſions upon us, if we have never heard ſpeak thereof elſewhere.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:110487:183"/>That which takes away the thought of theſe things is then that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready known to us, and that we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed thereunto. But if we cannot avoid this cauſe of human Infirmity, we may very well at leaſt humble our ſelves thereby, and make uſe of it to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that human Wit is of ſo little or no account, ſeeing that the ſame objects which have juſtly touched it at one time, doe not at another, through this vain circumſtance, that it is accuſtomed therunto; as though this cuſtome did change the nature of thoſe objects, and took any thing from them of what they have either of terrible or great.</p>
               <p n="19">19. 'Tis one of the reffections which the Sermons called bad gives leave to make, and many more may be added to it of this nature, in making uſe of what ſhocks us therein to know our proper faults. And in conſidering them in this proſpect, The more a Sermon is filled with human defects, the more it would be proper for us to ſerve as a draught of what we are, and the manner how we act. For the lives of Chriſtians ought to be a continual Preaching, which ſhould carry into the mind of others a lively Image of all Vertues. St. <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:110487:183"/>the Apoſtle recommends to us the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating of Humility in all things. <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militatem in omnibus inſinuantes,</hi> that is to ſay, that he wills Chriſtians to preach Humility in all their actions. The ſame may be ſaid of all other Vertues, and we ought to do nothing which may not help to engrave them in the heart of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as a Preacher ought to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is not edifying to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. Nevertheleſs how far are our actions from making this Impreſſion upon the minds of thoſe that ſee them? On the contrary what do we moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bring thither, but the Image of our Paſſions, of our diſorderly Motions, of our ſecret Intereſts? We preach al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt by our actions as they preach by their words, and we acquit our ſelves of the general Miniſtry of Chriſtians, as they acquit themſelves of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Miniſtry of Preachers: Let us not look upon their faults alone, but upon our own in theirs, and let us turn one part of that diſguſt we have for them againſt our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="20">20. If we look narrowly thereunto, we ſhall find that the particular faults into which they fall, do much reſemble ours, and have almoſt the ſame cauſes.</p>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:110487:184"/>
               <p>Theſe people follow generally their thoughts and phancies without reflecting whether they will be proportioned to the mind of thoſe who hearken to them. We follow alſo our Humours and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without any regard to proportion our Actions and Words to the minds of thoſe with whom we live, which is the reaſon that we ſtartle them a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ways, and that we do nothing that edifies them.</p>
               <p n="21">21. There are ſome Preachers who ſtartle underſtanding and judicious Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in crying out without reaſon upon ſmall things, in chaffing themſelves about things which deſerve it not, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king appear I know not how many falſe Motives, which incommode ſtrangely thoſe who have the <hi>Idea</hi> of Juſtice as well for the Motives as the things.</p>
               <p>But this defect, is it not infinitely, greater, and more frequent in our Lives than in Sermons? For how many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſlide into our actions and words, which are falſe, not according to Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, but according to Faith? Do we not often ſhew the inclination and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme we have for ſome actions, which ought to cauſe nothing but ſentiments of horror? Do we not receive often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:110487:184"/>with ſcorn, and diſdain things which ought to excite only Piety? How much do we extoll things which ought to appear mean, and diſdainful to us? How much do we cry down ſome things, which indeed are noble and worthy to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired? How cold do we ſpeak of thoſe we ought to have the greateſt concern for? They are ſo many falſe motives by ſo much more dangerous, as they ſpring from the bad diſpoſition of the heart; whereas thoſe of Preachers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note often only in them a ſimple, and meer want of wit.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The more one hath the Idea of juſtneſs, be it for things or for motives, the more one deſerves defects in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And hence one may ſay, that the reputation of many of them who make a great ſhew in this employment, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded upon the little light of their Auditors. If we had alſo underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpectators, and who had the Idea of the true motives that the objects ought to excite in us, the manner whereby we act and ſpeak, would become almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable to them. They would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee in us depraved Inclinations, unjuſt Impreſſions, lack of ſenſe and love for
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:110487:185"/>things which deſerve moſt, and they would find in reſpect of us, ſomething of that Holy Commotion, which Jeſus Chriſt ſhewed in regard of the Jews by theſe words. <hi>O generatio incredula quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque vos patiar!</hi> the meekneſs with which men bear with us, is not then any thing but the effect of blindneſs of men. We only ſurpaſs by the favour of their want of light, and it is very juſt that we ſhould ſuffer patiently in others, what they ſuffer continually from us.</p>
               <p n="23">23. What diverts Preachers from the right way, and caſts them upon falſe eloquence, upon vain thoughts, and of no edification, is often becauſe they have other proſpects, than they ought to have in acquitting themſelves of their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. They would appear Wiſe, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and Able, they would appear wits; in a word they ſpeak for themſelves, and not for their Auditors; and in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this manner, they ſpeak often neither for their Auditors nor themſelves. Theſe are likewiſe thoſe falſe Proſpects, which are mingled with our actions, which deſtroy the edification of them; if we had no other than to ſatisfy our obligation, and to ſerve our neighbor,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:110487:185"/>they would ſpread an odour of Piety, which would gain hearts inſenſibly, but the paſſions and ſecret deſires which are intermingled, hinder this effect, and produce ordinarily quite different impreſſions from thoſe we pretend. The deſire we make appear of exalting our ſelves, makes us diſ-eſteemed in the eyes of other men. We pleaſe ſo much leſs, by how much it appears that we have had a deſign to pleaſe: and by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral contradiction in men, they conceive juſtly paſſions, quite oppoſite to thoſe which they obſerve in us.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Theſe Preachers whereof we ſpeak are particularly proper to make known the wretchedneſs and the blindneſs of mens vanity. They tire themſelves in their Cloſets to bring forth brave thoughts; they overcharge their memory with labour, they diſtribute them with boldneſs, and afterwards they riſe from their Chair well ſatisfied with themſelves, imaging to have left a great Idea of themſelves in their Auditors. For men do not ſeek theſe pretended high thoughts for any thing elſe but to pleaſe, and it is difficult that in thinking to pleaſe others, men pleaſe not themſelves. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:110487:186"/>there is very often nothing at all that perſons of Piety have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration for theſe ſorts of Sermons. Thoſe who are not very charitable laugh at them, and almoſt all never think a quarter of an hour after them. 'Tis almoſt as men deal with us, when inſtead of ſearching the true good, they aim only at obtaining the good repute of men. We thereby become the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their diſdain and malignity, and thoſe who are the moſt favourable to us, ſcarce trouble themſelves with us, the ſpace of one quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p n="25">25. The ſubtilty of theſe Preachers may yet ſerve to make us obſerve how little help we get from others to correct our ſelves of our faults. For altho there be none more expoſed than thoſe of Preachers, nevertheleſs, there is nothing more ordinary than to ſee ſome who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main all their life, without finding one ſingle perſon, who advertiſes them of it. Men think that tis a civility due to teſtify to them, that they are ſatisfied with their Sermons; and thoſe Civilitys being received through Self-Love, paſs for ſincere teſtimonies and authentick approbations. Thus a Preacher decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:110487:186"/>by others, and by himſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues oftentimes to abuſe his Miniſtry all his life; he deſtroys inſtead of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he drains unprofitably, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Forces of his Body, but alſo thoſe of his Soul, which yet is impaired more than the Body by this employ, when he acquits himſelf not as he ought.</p>
               <p n="26">26. It is leſs ſtrange, that the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who are ſubject to none, correct themſelves in their faults but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. They are generally called to this Miniſtry, they preach when they will, and as they will, and no man is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerned how they do it. But who will not be aſtoniſh'd, that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers choſen by regular Societies, where men admit them not to this Miniſtry, but with Diſcretion, Caution, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deliberation, ſhould oftentimes make ſhew of ſo little Spirituality and Light in their Sermons, and that they ſhould not ſtuff them leſs than others, with mean and unprofitable Scholaſtick terms.</p>
               <p>That which ought to increaſe our admiration upon this point, is that in the ſame Orders wherein men ſuffer;
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:110487:187"/>Thus perſons to preach as they pleaſe, and with faults viſibly contrary to the intent of their Miniſtry; they ſhould not ſuffer them to make a falſe ſtep in their Ceremonies, a miſtake in bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or that they ſhould want the leaſt of their regular Practices. There are in theſe ſorts of Societies, puniſhments ordained for all faults, againſt regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but there are none at all for thoſe who abuſe the word of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in diſtributing it to the people in vain, and abſtract thoughts, inſtead of giving them a ſolid nouriſhment, and proportion'd to their occaſions; or in deſtroying the fruit of the Truths they declared by an oſtentation of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Eloquence. They leave ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to the Preachers, the manner whereby they acquit themſelves of their Miniſtry. They let them follow their Ideas, and if they give them ſome Rules to govern themſelves by, they are ſo extravagant, and ſo little exact, that they think to follow them, by doing quite the contrary to what they ought.</p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:110487:187"/>
               <p n="27">27. We cannot doubtleſs, alleadge any other reaſon for this Conduct, unleſs that they know very well in theſe Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, in what conſiſts the manner of practiſing the Ceremonies; but have a very ſmall Idea, what 'tis to pronounce Gods Word in a way worthy of him, and know ſcarcely the importance of ſome faults which are committed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing of this Miniſtry, and in relating it to our Selves, and not to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of our Auditors.</p>
               <p>This is the concluſion which methinks ſhould be drawn from thence, but it extends it ſelf much further than this example; and if we will do our ſelves juſtice, we ſhall find that it Concerns us divers and ſundry ways. Becauſe we are exact in the practice of certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Duties, even to the being fixed thereunto, in a ſuperſticious and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner; but we have only very confus'd Ideas of the greateſt part of Spiritual Duties, and Interiour Virtues; which is the reaſon that we ſcarcely know the faults we commit againſt theſe Duties and Virtues. We know not what true Humility, inward mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the love of Juſtice, the dependance
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:110487:188"/>upon God, and the deſire of ſuffering is: And as they are theſe inward Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which are the ſource of the Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Edification, which ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into our Actions and Words; it is not ſtrange, that not knowing them, and likewiſe not having a true Idea of them, there is nothing that's edifying either in our Converſation, or in our Lives.</p>
